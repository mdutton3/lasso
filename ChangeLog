	fix pkg-config typo.

2014-08-06  Niko Tyni  <ntyni@debian.org>

	Use INSTALLDIRS=vendor for the Perl bindings, as per the Debian Perl policy
	Debian packaged Perl modules should be installed into the vendor
	directories (currently /usr/lib/perl5 and /usr/share/perl5), but the
	upstream default puts the into the 'site' ones (modified with the
	PREFIX setting.) Explicitly using INSTALLDIRS=vendor simplifies
	the install rules and removes the need for PREFIX, which has
	been deprecated in ExtUtils::MakeMaker for a long time.

2014-07-30  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Restore not-unused code
	Clang was wrong on one instance, a value must be initialized to its NULL
	state before using any lasso_assign_ macro with it.

	Bug introduced in 4789e8d4d68eb.

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	One more uninitialized value
	encode_key may be release when not initialized if va_args returns null
	on the first while loop.

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Fix potential null dereference errors
	Ina  number of cases function inputs are not checked for NULL although
	values may end up with a NULL value and then they are dereferenced
	directly.
	Check values in the function (or the caller) if appropriate.

	License: MIT

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Do not dereference null pointers
	Sounds like these should all be boolean 'OR's, otherwise,
	if profile is not in fact a lasso profile then profile->private_data
	will be dereferenced even if it is NULL.
	Found by Clang

	Rearrange case checking to avoid compiler warnings
	The compiler was complaining that 'compa' could be uninitialized.
	USe this occasion to make the code simpler to understand and assign
	actually meaningful values to the variable, even though the proper
	actions are not implemented yet.

	Trim unused code
	Clang complains these values are never used, avoid even assigning them.

	License: MIT

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Trim dead code
	These conditions can never be reached as the list is filtered with
	and and to the value of 0xff, so just drop them, they are misleading.
	(Also silences checkers which were screaming of deadcode, for each and
	every unmatchable value ...)

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Fix confusing loop test
	Coverity was marking the check for tsnippet after the while loop,
	confused by the check. Make it more readable, and in the process
	make checkers happy too.

	License: MIT

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Fix some uninitialized value
	The compiler complain about these values not being initialized.
	come of them do not really matter as they are only really used when
	later initialized in the code and the code paths would not use them
	if not initialized in a previous block, however some of these seem
	real issues.
	In all cases make the compiler happy so we get less noise in the build
	and less false positives in code chckers.

	License: MIT

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Missing check for Sig_Alg value
	Initialize the sig_alg value to NULL (The compilers was complaining it may
	be used initialized), but also make sure to check the re is any sig_alg at
	all, otherwise return a proper error.

	License: MIT

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Fix boundary check
	Coverity was marking this as an array overun as the check would never be
	possible and wuld allow any value for query_request_type, including "unset"
	wihch is 0.
	fix the boundary checks.

	License: MIT

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Fix uninitialized values found by Coverity
	These values where being used without being initialized at least in some edge
	cases. Make Coverity happy by properly initializing them.
	Some of these are real bugs, not just silencing a tool.

	License: MIT

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Fix format check for date
	Coverity was complaining that tm was used uninitialized, but the truth is
	that a third error condition where the string passed in matches no valid
	format was not handled. Just return an error in that case.

	License: MIT

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Fix error checking in xml.c
	Coverity was complaining that 'integer' was being used without
	initialization (from the caller). Turns out it was erroneously used
	to test the result instead of the just sourced 'what'.

	License: MIT

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Fixes for unchecked return values
	Coverity complains that in a number of places errors are not checked.
	Some of them are ok not to check so put a silencing (void).
	Check errors that need to be checked.

	Coverity also complains g_malloc() return is never checked but given it is
	never checked anywahere let it be for now.

2014-07-30  Simo Sorce  <simo@redhat.com>

	Be correct in dealing with varargs
	Although in this cases it may be safe to omit va_end() that is not generally
	so with an arbitrary compiler on an arbitrary platform.

	Quoting from the spec: "Each invocation of va_start() must be matched by
	a corresponding invocation of va_end() in the same function."
	note the "must"

	Checker tools like Coverity complain if va_start() is not always paired with
	va_end(), so this patch mutes them.

	After lasso_login_build_artifact_msg() you must save the return of

	corresponding to the return value of lasso_profile_get_artifact()
	reinstall the artifact message using lasso_profile_set_artifact_message()
	just before calling lasso_login_build_response_msg().

	[xml] rewrite schema directed serialization/deserialization methods
	The new implementations of lasso_node_impl_init_from_xml now validate
	namespace of all child nodes befores parsing. It stops on any error. For
	node which implement their own parsing of an attribute or a node, it
	must declare an XmlSnippet with an offset field set to 0. The 0 value is
	invalid for public GObject structure (it's the place of the GObject
	machinery like the reference count). The 0 offset can be used for
	XmlSnippet in a private structure, so never set the offset to 0 with the
	flag SNIPPET_PRIVATE, for a field which is parsed by you get_xmlNode
	virtual method.

	Other ameliorations in this commit is the possibility to set attributes
	with namespace when using the flags SNIPPET_ATTRIBUTE|SNIPPET_ANY. The
	syntax for an attribute is inspired by the element tree API from Python:

		{namespace}attribute_name

	an example:

		{http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance}type

	for the classic xsi:type attribute.

	[core] add method lasso_provider_set_specific_signing_key
	Using this method you can specify a signing which will be used for

2011-11-21  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[core] multiple decryption keys support
	This commit complements the support for multiple signing certificate
	support in the metadata files. The use-case is still key roll-over.

	The structure LassoServerPrivateData was changed to accomodate multiple
	decryption keys, and so:

	 xmlSecKey *encryption_private_key

	became:

	 GList *encryption_private_keys

	All uses of this key were replaced by a loop over this list, terminating
	with the first key to be able to decrypt the content.

	The private key passed to lasso_server_new() or
	lasso_server_new_from_buffers() is first added to the list of decryption
	keys. Any other call to
	lasso_server_set_encryption_private_key_with_password() or
	lasso_server_set_encryption_private_key() will add a new key to the
	list.

	[tests] add sample metadata for testing metadata with multiple key descriptors

2011-05-19  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[core] first try at multiple signing keys support
	The idea was to replace every use of an xmlSecKey* by a loop over a
	GList* of xmlSecKey*.

	 - In the structure LassoProviderPrivate changed
	    xmlSecKey*public_key            ->   GList* signing_public_keys
	    xmlNode*signing_key_descriptor  ->   GList* signing_key_descriptors.
	 - Renamed lasso_provider_try_loading_public_key to
	   lasso_provider_try_loading_public_keys and chaned its signature
	   accordingly
	 - Renamed lasso_provider_get_public_key to
	   lasso_provider_get_public_keys and changed the signature accordingly.
	 - Changed lasso_provider_get_encryption_public_key to return the first
	   signing key from the list as a temporary work around. Multiple
	   encryption keys will be supported later.
	 - Changed lasso_provider_load_public_key to load keys from the passed
	   file on the LassoProvider constructor, from every key descriptors
	   found for signing and eventually from the key descriptor marked for
	   encryption.
	 - Every failure to load from a file or an XML KeyInfo descriptor are
	   noew reported as warning.
	 - Query signature checking was completely moved to
	   lasso_provider_verify_query_signature and
	   lasso_provider_verify_signature now calls it.
	 - lasso_provider_verify_signature is now using lasso_verify_signature
	   from the xml/tools.o module.
	 - lasso_provider_verify_single_signature was modified to support
	   multiple signing keys.

2011-04-14  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[core] add flags parameter to lasso_server_load_metadata to tune signature checking on metadata files
	The flags parameter allows to control the checking of digital signature
	upon EntityDescriptor and EntitiesDescriptor nodes in SAML 2.0 metadata
	files.

	The default behaviour is to check all found signatures and to inherit
	signature from EntitiesDescriptor to their children.

	By only enabling checking of EntityDescrtiptor node signatures it's also
	possible to only check signature at the EntityDescriptor level and so
	only trust individual entities and not the aggregating provider.

2011-04-04  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[core] update documentation of lasso_server_load_metadata

2011-04-04  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[core] make lasso_server_load_metadata load any metadata file
	The new code can load metadata file with a EntityDescriptor root node,
	and with nested EntitiesDescriptor.

	Idea and prototype by Olav Morken.

2011-04-04  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[server] in lasso_server_load_metadata do not duplicate checks already made by lasso_verify_signature
	lasso_verify_signature already checks that reference is to the given
	signed node, be it referenced through an ID or through an empty
	reference.

	[xml] if signature reference is empty check that signed node is the document root
	An empty reference means the complete document, so the signed node is
	the root element of this document. We must check that the parameter
	signe_node dmatches our assumption.

	[core] rename lasso_server_load_federation to lasso_server_load_metadata
	The aim of this function is now to load any metadata file, and to
	replace completely the use of lasso_server_add_provider.
	The metadata content argument is replaced by a metadata file path to
	more closely match other APIs.

	[web] update download page

2011-03-30  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[core] add a loaded_entity_ids output parameter to lasso_server_load_federation
	It allows to know which entity has been loaded from the metadata file.
	It must be freed by the caller.

	[core] add a blacklisted_entity_ids parameter to lasso_server_load_federation
	The goal is to prevent loading of provider known to have problems.

	[tests] remove spurious output

	[tests] continue improving the lasso_server_load_federation test cases

	[tests] test lasso_server_load_federation
	The test operates on the metadata file of the french university network
	Renater.

	[tests] add renater federation metadata file for testing

	[core] add a lasso_server_load_federation method
	This method allows to load providers in bulk from what is called a
	federation file, i.e a SAML metadata file containing declarations for
	more than one provider. Those file are usually signed to bind some trust
	to its content, so lasso_server_load_federation can take an optional
	file path to a certificate chain file used to check the signature on the
	given XML content. Only same document signature is accepted (i.e. there
	must be only one XML signature reference and it should be to the empty
	string meaning the « current » document).

	[core] add a private constructor to build LassoProvider object from an xmlNode
	I'm not sure of the need outside lasso so I will let this method private
	for the moment. It's an helper method for the
	lasso_server_load_federation method which traverses an
	EntitiesDescriptor node to find all the EntityDescriptor contained
	inside.

	[saml2] add and internal method to load a federation metadata file
	It only loads one kind of provider (idp or sp). It's currently
	impossible for a provider to have the two roles at the same time toward
	a given LassoServer object, i.e. the current service is a service
	provider or an identity provider, it cannot be the two at the same time.

	[saml2] improve reporting of errors when loading a provider metadata file

	If lasso_profile_get_signature_verify_hint() forbid to check signature,
	we do not check.
	If the SP advise to check signature, we check.
	If lasso_profile_get_signature_verify_hint() forces to check signature,
	we do not check.
	In all other cases we only check if a signature is present, i.e. we

	[SAMLv2 NID management] report signature error in response, do not check response signature if forbidden
	 - build_response_msg will report signature error in response status
	   code when called without an initialized response (without a call to
	   validate_request)
	 - process_response_msg now use
	   lasso_saml20_profile_check_signature_status to check the signature

	[SAMLv2] when failing to recreate the content for the ArtefactResponse set a lasso specific status code

2010-09-03  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[SAMLv2] change the way content is stored and loaded for the HTTP-Artifact binding
	Previously content was stored as the result of lasso_node_dump method
	then reloaded, and then serialized again as part of the ArtifactResponse
	message. lasso_node_dump was ignoring all hint to sign node, but keeping
	the needed parameters around. That's not what must be done, the
	signature should happen at the generation of the artifact and the result
	must manipulated as is (i.e. XML content) and never moved back to the
	land of LassoNode objects.

	Now the content is:
	- first removed of any signature at the message level, because the
	  ArtifactResponse will take care of this, (any signature under this
	  level (like at the assertion) is kept),
	- serialized using lasso_node_export_to_xml,
	- reloaded using lasso_xml_parse_memory,
	- and put into the ArtifactResponse using a
	  lasso_misc_text_node_new_with_xml_node.

2010-09-03  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[SAMLv2] make lasso_saml20_profile_generate_artifact a static function
	It is only used in lasso/saml-2.0/profile.c anyway.

2010-09-03  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[Core] load signature parameters
	Generic signature parameters (attached as qdata to nodes) is now
	reloaded when initializing a node from XML for a node type with a
	signature snippet in its metadatas.

	It fixes the problematic usage of ciphered private keys with the
	HTTP-Artifact binding (which needs to keep a copy of the AuthnResponse
	around and to sign it later).

2010-09-03  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[Core] add private function to read an integer attribute
	This function does integer parsing and range checks, it returns TRUE if
	all goes well.

	It helps making range checks.

2010-09-03  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[Strings] add string constant for the internal XML attributes used in dumps
	Add string constants for signature method, signature type, private key

	assumed all constant strings were char*.

	[SAMLv2] fix string in comment

	[SAMLv2] replace use of lasso_provider_get_default_name_id_format with direct use of lasso_provider_get_metadata_one_for_role
	The first is trying to use provider->role to know which kind of role
	descriptor to lookup, but for the server object this field is 0 and when
	building authn request we know that we want our default NameIDFormat for
	the SP sso descriptor.

2010-08-25  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[SAMLv2] rebuild specialized LassoProvider methods upon new endpoints storage
	The new way of storing endpoints allows to keep ordering between
	endpoints with respect to the order of the index and isDefault field for
	indexed endpoint type, and to the XML node orders for other endpoints.

	It also simplifies the code.

2010-08-25  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[Core] add destroy code for new private field endpoints
	The contained string must be disallocated if the object is destroyed.

	[Core] add structure to store endpoints type for metadata files
	This new C structure will allow to filter ID-FFv1.2 and SAMLv2 endpoints
	more easily.

	[XML] use strtol instead of atoi to parse XSchema integers
	This commit also reject negative integers from being parsed (all integers
	in SAMLv2 and ID-FFv1.2 schemas are positive integers).

	[SAMLv2] when AuthnRequest contains invalid attributes returns INVALID_REQUEST not NO_DEFAULT_ENDPOINT
	This is the right status to return.

	[SAMLv2] simplify logic for handling AuthnResponse with binding HTTP-Post
	The logic is now simpler:
	 - first lasso_saml20_profile_process_any_response check the signature
	   on the message
	 - then lasso_saml20_login_process_response_status_and_assertion
	   traverse all the assertions:
	   - if the message is signed all assertion from the same issuer are
	     automatically accepted,
	   - if the message is not signed, or the signature validation failed,
	     or the assertion has a different issuer than the message, we check
	     the signature directly on the assertion. If any of the assertions
	     fails the signature check, the result will be
	     LASSO_PROFILE_ERROR_CANNOT_VERIFY_SIGNATURE.

	The public field profile->signature_status will contain only the message
	level signature status, each assertion signature status is not
	accessible. That will change when signature and key handling is
	reworked.

	[SAMLv2/SSO] when processing AuthnResponse with binding HTTP-Post only the assertion need to be signed
	If the message is signed, the assertion is also covered, but if only the
	assertion is signed, there is no error to report. If the caller ask for
	forcing the validation of message signature, then we report an error.

	This commit also add checking for the binding used, if it is not
	HTTP-Post lasso_login_process_authn_response_msg will now report an
	error.

	Plug lasso_node_set_signature into

	 * also use lasso_node_get_signature in has_signature

	 * add forgottent LASSO_PROFILE_SIGNATURE_VERIFY_HINT_FORCE in switch
	   cases

	For AuthnResponse checking the semantic is now that if HINT_FORCE is
	used we verify message signature *and* assertion signature. If
	HINT_MAYBE is used we check the assertion signature if its issuer
	differs from the message issuer.

	[ID-FFv1.2] move all user of lasso_node_export_to_query to lasso_node_export_to_query_with_password

	[Core] Change lasso_apply_signature to use quark stored annotated signature parameters
	The node containing signature do not handle the private keys passwords.
	As the fields for signature parameters are part of the public ABI we
	cannot add the password field to the public structure for those nodes.
	Instead we use the new quark annotation accessed through
	lasso_node_get/set_signature, and if the sign_type parameter is non-NULL
	we use it instead of the parameters stored in the public structure.
	This is a gross hack :( but at least it is documented.

	[Core] add password parameter to lasso_sign_node

	[Code] add a lasso_node_export_to_query_with_password method

	[Core] add a password parameter to lasso_query_sign
	We force use of the password through a custom OpenSSL password callback.

	[Core] dump custom signature parameters in lasso dumps
	The signature parameters are serialized as global attributes from the
	http://lasso.entrouvert.org/lasso/namespaces/0.0 named:
	SignatureType
	SignatureMethod
	PrivateKey
	PrivateKeyPassword
	Certificate

	[Tests/python] add test case for WebSSO with providers using encrypted keys

	[Core] add lasso_node_set_signature and lasso_node_get_signature
	Those two methods allows to associate signature parameters to any node.
	They keep it inside the CustomElement quark. Using a private structure
	may be more performant.

2010-07-12  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[Core] extract signature adding into base class method lasso_node_get_xmlNode
	In order to permit subclass to modify the base xmlNode created by
	lasso_node_impl_get_xmlNode we must defer the concrete to the virtual
	method wrapper, lasso_node_get_xmlNode.

	To do that it whas needed to make id_attribute another virtual field of
	LassoNode subclasses (it can be accessed through an offset registered in
	the class object).

	This commit solves signature validation error since the patch for
	managing more than one SessionIndex element in samlp2:LogoutRequest.

	It also factorize the creation of signatures in one place.

2010-07-12  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[SAMLv2] if service provider supports logout, add a SessionIndex from the assertion ID
	The standard mandate to provide a SessionIndex to service provider
	advertaising their support of the logout profile. We follow the
	convention of using the assertion ID as a SessionIndex.

	[Tests] add a sso then slo soap test

	[Core] lasso_check_version does not return a proper error code
	lasso_check_version returns 0, 1 or -1 and one is not a proper error
	code, so the original int return type is kept.

	[Bindings] make is_rc only check for lasso_error_t type

	[Bindings php5] simplify is_object in php_code.py

	[Core] change return type of all error returning methods
	The new return type is lasso_error_t, it should allow to pinpoint easily
	methods returning an error code in bindings.

	[Bindings java] use is_int instead of custom methods or code

	[Bindings perl] add lasso_errot_t to type to map to T_IV typemap (integer types)

	[Bindings] add lasso_error_t to return code types

	[Binding java] use is_rc to match error return type

	[Binding php5] use is_rc to match error return type

	[Core] add lasso_error_t to list of integer types

	[Core] add a lasso_error_t typedef
	This typedef will serve to mark error returning methods.
	The ctypes.h header piggyback on export.h to be included in all public
	headers.

2010-07-05  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[Provider] Fix loading of provider without a public key
	This commit also emit propre warning when loading fails for a provider
	*with* a public key.

	[Python binding] do not throw lasso.Error for python exceptions

2010-06-29  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[Perl binding] make include from $(srcdir) works in Perl binding

	[Bindings] accept simple string in string<->xmlNode converter
	Some use case ask for passing simple libxml content node (i.e just an
	UTF-8 string) when a method argument or a field of the xmlNode* type.
	This commit add a static method in bindings/utils.c named
	lasso_string_fragment_to_xmlnode which does this transform by trying to
	parse an XML document then by trying to parse a well balanced XML
	fragment of only one node (if there is more than one node such as in the
	string " xxx <tag/> yyy ", we free the node list and return NULL).

	[Core] add macro to release an xmlNodeList object

	[ID-WSF2] add idwsf2 test script to test suite
	Re-activate ID-WSF 2.0 test script. Fix problem with provider issuing
	assertion role. Need to be fixed more generally in the future.

	[Core] add macro to release GList of xmlNodeList

	[Core] add macros to manipulate xmlNodeList and GList of xmlNodeList
	The method to copy them is xmlCopyNodeList and not xmlCopyNode, so we
	need another set of macros.

	Merge branch 'issue-101'

2010-06-18  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[Tests/integration] add G_DEBUG=gc-friendly env. var to valgrind-wrapper
	It should improve valgrind ability to trace memory origin.

2010-06-17  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	[XML] in lasso_node_export_to_paos_request check return value of lasso_node_get_xmlNode

	[XML] in _lasso_node_export_to_xml check return value of lasso_node_get_xmlNode

2010-06-15  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Comment out custom silent rules if automake < 1.11

	[Core] do not ignore keep_xmlnode flag inherited from parent classes
	We only looked to the keep_xmlnode flag in the node data of the top
	level class, but any parent class can set this flag and in this case we
	must honor it too.

2010-06-14  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Test: add non regression test for reloading a server dump with encrypted keys

2010-06-14  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core: when reloading a dump, use the signing private key password for loading the encryption private key
	We currently do not store the encryption private key, instead on reload
	of a dump, we try to use the signing private key as the encryption
	private key. But we forgot to use the stored private key password.
	That's now fixed.

	Next step would be to keep the encryption private key around also.

2010-06-14  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Binding python: fix freeing of list return values for methods with the transfer full flag
	The output 'print' were missing, oups :(

2010-06-12  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Binding python: find a work around for random behaviour of PyImport_ImportModule
	 * it seems that PyImport_ImportModule is not deterministic. Sometimes it
	   returns True for modules which we know are present ('logging').
	   Importing 'sys' first seems to make 'logging' accessible (complete
	   cargo cult programming).

	Core: move logging function and macros to their own module, adapt perl binding

	Core: move lasso_strerror declaration to errors.h

	add .gitignore file

	Tools: add check-makefile.sh script to tools

	add abi file for 2.2.91

	Tests: add idp6-saml2 data

	Test: add python test for attribute requesting
	 * What's tested:
	  - request initialization
	  - adding attribute designators
	  - building the request message
	  - processing the request message
	  - accepting the request
	  - adding assertion with attributes
	  - signing the assertion
	  - building the response
	  - parsing the response

	SAMLv2: rename lasso_saml2_name_id_build_persistent to lasso_saml2_name_id_new_with_persistent_format
	 * keep the old one for compatibility
	 * new one will be picked by bindings as a constructor

	SAMLv2: when initializing signture on assertion, setup an ID if there is none
	 * without the ID lasso refuse to sign (it's mandatory)

	SAMLv2: in lasso_assertion_query_build_request_msg setup nameid
	 * lasso_profile_get_nameIdentifier does not return profile->nameIdentifier
	,
	   so we first try to use profile->nameIdentifier and if it is NULL we use
	   lasso_profile_get_nameIdentifier.

	Binding python: fix bad refcounting in get_logger and lasso_python_log

2010-06-10  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core: update lasso_iso_8601_gmt_to_time_t to support milliseconds
	 * We now support the two possible formats for xsdtime XSchema datatype:
	    - dddd-dd-ddTdd:dd:ddZ
	    - dddd-dd-ddTdd:dd:dd.d*Z

	   Where d denotes a digit, and * is the kleene star.

	   XSD datetime also supports negative years, but as we cannot represent
	   them with time_t, we can reject it at the lexical level.

2010-06-10  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Documentation: add new AssertionQuery methods to documentation

	Tests: new python test for setEncryptionPrivateKeyWithPassword

	Fix long lines in lasso/id-ff/server.c

	 * fixes #90

	SAMLv2: fix initialization of subject in lasso_assertion_query_build_request_msg

	Import tools in utils.h

	Fix collision between defined symbols in tools.h and private.h

	Binding python: if lasso.logger exists use it for logging
	 * There is now two paths to get a logger in the python binding:
	   - first try to get an objet from lasso.logger
	   - if it doesn't exist or is None, the try logging.getLogger('lasso')

2010-06-09  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Change all logging to use message()

	Core: in xml error message handler, escape messages to fit on one line

	Core: remove arrow in log messages

	Binding python: call lasso_init() first in init_lasso()

	Binding python: add GLog handler to redirect logs to Python logger named "lasso"
	 * fixes #20

	Utils: add function to extract/create node in lists
	 * lasso_extract_gtype_from_list_or_new will help for method with create
	   or extend nodes in lists.

2010-06-09  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	Add new lasso_log_set_handler and lasso_log_remove_handler functions
	They are modeled around the g_log... functions of GLib, they just don't
	have a domain parameter.

2010-06-06  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Binding perl: fix test so that it does not raise on add_provider

	Bindings: keep retro compatibility for member field names
	 * Special kludge price go to PHP:
	   methods name are insensitive so nothing to do here, BUT, if you use
	   getters/setters then your objects fields can be case insensitive too
	   ;-) (DNS, dns, DnS, dNs all maps to get_dns ).

	Bindings: fix camelcasing of id fields

	SAMLv2: make role checking inactive for LassoServer
	 * LassoServer have no role defined, so checking breaks loading of
	   metadata for LassoServer.

	ID-FFv1.2: for idp initiated sso accept any nameIdPolicy
	 * IdP initiated SSO can be of any kind, no need to limit it.

2010-06-04  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	SAML 2.0: add checks for proper loading of role descriptors
	 * remove warning for descriptors supporting non SAML 2.0 protocols
	 * checks that at least one descriptor was loaded and that it was for
	   our assigned role.

	SAMLv2: fix error in naming of function in the documentation

2010-05-31  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	SAMLv2: remove HTTP-Redirect as right binding for AssertionConsumer

	SAMLv2: fix bug giving UnuspportedProfile for SingleSignOn with HTTP-POST
	 * The string constant in lasso_saml20_provider_accept_http_method was
	   HTTP-Post instead of HTTP-POST.

	Core: fix extraction of relaystate when URLs contains only one kind of separators

	Integration test: adapt to new behaviour for federation termination

	SAMLv2: simplify lasso_saml20_provider_accept_http_method by only checking for remote provider support
	 * Whatever we do, with asyncrhonous bindings the remote provider can
	   return the response with any asynchronous binding.

	SAML 2.0: in lasso_login_build_assertion set conditions time limit, no SubjectConfirmationData limits

	SAML 2.0: in lasso_login_build_assertion do not conflate sessionNotOnOrAfter with assertion condition notOnOrAfter

2010-05-11  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Website: add quicklinks for download links

	Change VCS viewer link to point toward the redmine browser

	SAMLv2: conflate Responder and Requester when checking second level status code
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/login.c:
	   I'm not sure that most IdP really make the semantic distinction
	   between those two first level status codes, so just conflate them.

	SAMLv2: remove warning message for invalid signature on AuthnResponse messages
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/login.c:
	   we already return an error, no need to clutter the output with
	   warning messages.

2010-05-04  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Fix uninitialized local variable

	in lasso_session_count_assertions, do not emit warning if session is not an object

	SAML 2.0: always restart initial request processing in lasso_logout_build_response_msg
	 * Does it also in process_response_msg if no more assertions are
	   present.
	 * Take into account that lasso_saml20_profile_process_any_response
	   already check for the status code, and so specify finer error code in
	   the cleanup code.

	SAML 2.0: fix lasso_saml20_provider_get_first_http_method
	 * LassoServer object can have many roles, use the default role of the
	   remote provider to decide on which to assume.

	SAML 2.0 Logout: in init_request, remove the assertion anyway
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/logout.c:
	   when initiating a logout, if no problem is found, remove the assertion.
	   you can always continue by changing profile->http_request_method to
	   SOAP for example and redo a build_request_msg.

	SAML 2.0: lasso_saml20_profile_process_any_response_msg, change status code checking

2010-04-22  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	SAML 2.0: lasso_logout_build_response_msg, just verify there is saved data from a previous request before switching them
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/logout.c:
	   There is no need to check what the previous remote provider ID was,
	   just that initial_remote_providerID is not NULL in order to switch
	   request, response and remote_providerID.

	SAML 2.0: in lasso_saml20_process_federation, only handle the case of PERSISTENT format
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/login.c:
	   in lasso_saml20_process_federation:
	   - if no name id format can be found by the request, use the default from
	     the metadata file (first declared NameIDFormat)
	   - instead of checking if format is TRANSIENT, check if it is PERSISTENT,
	     and proceed with the federation, if not just return 0.
	   - return LASSO_PROFILE_ERROR_UNKNOWN_PROVIDER instead of
	     LASSO_SERVER_ERROR_PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND.
	   - in any case, check for consent.

	   change signature of lasso_idwsf2_profile_init_soap_fault_response.
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/data_service.c:
	   use new function instead of manually intializing soap faults
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/discovery.c:
	   init a soap fault when parsed request is of an unknown type, return
	   proper error.

	ID-WSF 2.0 python tests: finish tests for new ID-WSF 2.0 API
	 * bindings/python/tests/idwsf2_tests.py:
	   all Discovery service request types are tested, and Data Service

	      svcmdids; use lasso_check_good_rc when needed.

	ID-WSF 2.0: change signature of lasso_idwsf2_discovery_add_identity_to_epr
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/discovery.c:
	   - in lasso_idwsf2_discovery_add_identity_to_epr, receive an Epr
	     instead of an EprMetadata node, and use
	     lasso_wsa_endpoint_reference_add_security_token to add the
	     assertion token instead of duplicating this logic.
	   - in lasso_idwsf2_discovery_build_epr change the call site.

	ID-WSF 2.0: fix documentation of lasso_idwsf2_data_service_build_request_msg

	SAML 2.0: in lasso_saml2_assertion_get_issuer_provider, check type of server argument

	Core: add a level argument to lasso_xmlnode_to_string and _lasso_node_export_to_xml

2010-02-22  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Binding perl: add support for out parameters
	 * bindings/perl/lang.py:
	   support GObject out parameters.

	SAML 2.0: LassoSaml2ConditionAbstract does not match its element name anymore, add a registry mapping
	 * lasso/xml/saml-2.0/saml2_condition_abstract.c:
	   last commit to this file changed the element name from
	   ConditionAbstract to Condition so the XML parser cannot find the
	   corresponding GObject class anymore.

	SAML 2.0: add more accessors for Conditions
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/saml2_helper.{c,h}:
	   distribute code from lasso_saml2_assertion_validate_conditions to
	   lasso_saml2_assertion_validate_time_checks and
	   lasso_saml2_assertion_validate_audience.
	   add lasso_saml2_assertion_allows_proxying and
	   lasso_saml2_assertion_allows_proxying_to, to respectively check for
	   proxying of the current assertion, and for proxying to a specific
	   provider (you must call both of them to test completely the proxying
	   status of an assertion).
	 * docs/reference/lasso/lasso-sections.txt:
	   reference new functions into documentation.

	Bindings python: use more accessors from utils.py
	 * binings/python/lang.py: remove direct access to type tuples in favor
	   of using accesors from utils.py.

	Bindings: make is_int more robust, and fix remove_modifiers

	SAML 2.0: fix bad name of Condition element, keep xmlNode as it is abstract
	 * lasso/xml/saml-2.0/saml2_condition_abstract.c:
	   saml2:Condition is an element whose type is abstract, it must be used
	   as an extension point helped by the xsi:type field. As the content is
	   unknown before hand we must keep the original xmlNode for later
	   analysis.

	Bindings python tests: update idwsf2_tests.py

	Bindings: in utils.py, make clean_type handle None value

	ID-WSF 2.0: reorganize EPR minting, add a process_request method to disco service
	 * data_service.c:
	   remove dependency on discovery.h
	 * discovery.{c,h}:
	   - add a lasso_idwsf2_discovery_process_request_msg to extract request
	     data before validate request (SvcMDID, SvcMD or RequestService).
	   - store SvcMDID in a private field, add a setter for it.
	   - SvcMDID is now used for building response to MDAssociationQuery and
	     parsing request for MDQuery, MDDelete, MDAssociationAdd and
	     MDAssociationDelete.
	 * idwsf2_helper.{c,h}:
	   - change security mechanism argument of
	     lasso_wsa_endpoint_reference_add_security_token from a NULL
	     terminated string array to a GList.
	 * saml2_login.{c,h}:

	     minting assertion for ID-WSF 2.0 security, to be used in Discovery
	     bootstap EPR creation and EPR minting for Discovery service Query
	     responses.
	   - add a lasso_saml2_assertion_get_discovery_bootstrap_epr, and
	     rewirte lasso_login_idwsf2_get_discovery_bootstrap_epr to use it.
	   - make lasso_login_idwsf2_add_discovery_bootstrap_epr accept a list
	     of security mechanisms, not just one.
	 * tests/idwsf2_tests.c:
	   - adapt to new argument type of

	Fix lasso_extract_gobject_from_list

2010-02-21  Mikael Ates  <mates@entrouvert.com>

2010-02-17  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Documentation: add example to LassoLogout, fix bad markup in id-wsf-2.0/profile.c

	ID-WSF 2.0: also check sender match assertion in lasso_idwsf2_profile_check_security_mechanism
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/profile.c:
	   for BEARER mechanism, also check that the SPNameQualifier of the
	   Subject match the Sender of the request.

	ID-WSF 2.0: add lasso_idwsf2_discovery_get_svcmdids to public API

	Tests integration: force C locale
	 * tests/integration/saml2/__init__.py:
	   authentic now use 'system locale' by default, so force C locale to
	   get english IHM string to make twill happy.

	SAML 2.0: if assertion possess a signed original_xmlnode return it instead of using get_xmlNode
	 * lasso/xml/saml-2.0/saml2_assertion.c:
	   assertion in lasso when read are not usable anymore because the
	   signature is lost, this commit allows to keep assertion unaltered
	   after reading them if they contained a top level signature (a
	   signature contained in the Assertion node).
	   This is useful for reusing assertion kept in a LassoSession object
	   and for using assertion as security token for ID-WSF.

	Core: use lasso_xmlnode_to_string in LassoNode export functions
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   remove duplicate codes and use lasso_xmlnode_to_string instead.

	Current state of ID-WSF 2.0 python test

	Binding php5: fix generation of list freeing
	 * bindings/php5/wrapper_source.py:
	   free_glist wants a GList** as first argument.

	Core: add a lasso_xmlnode_to_string function
	 * lasso/xml/tools.c lasso/xml/private.h:
	   lots of functions duplicate this code, so we factorized it there.
	   It has two parameters, the xmlnode and boolean deciding whether to
	   format the resulting content (good for reading but bad for
	   signatures).

	SAML 2.0: in lasso_saml20_profile_set_session_from_dump_decrypt, really decrypt
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/profile.c:
	   dump for already signed assertion containing an EncryptedID as
	   Subject does not work as before, the decrypted NameID is no more
	   included in it, so instead of trying to plug it in the NameID field
	   we resort to really deciphering the EncryptedID.
	   That could be a performance problem if the session object is stuffed
	   with a lot of assertions.

	Current state of idwsf2 tests

	ID-WSF 2.0: fix loading of LassoIdWsf2Discovery dumps

	Core: add error exit to lasso_node_new_from_xmlNode
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   if building of the node fails, we must keep the initialization of
	   custom nodename and namespace.

	Binding python: simplify special constructor, use cptrToPy

	ID-WSF 2.0: make lasso_idwsf2_profile_redirect_user_for_interaction add the transactionID to the URL
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/profile.c:
	   simplify use of lasso_idwsf2_profile_redirect_user_for_interaction by
	   directly adding the ID of the SOAP response message to the URL.
	   Report an error if no MessageID can be found.

	ID-WSF 2.0: rewrite and document lasso_soap_envelope_sb2_get_redirect_request_url
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/soap_binding.{c,h}:
	   fix error in conception of
	   lasso_soap_envelope_sb2_get_redirect_request_url, RedirectRequest is
	   part of a SOAP fault not the headers.
	   Explain in the documentation how to use the RedirectRequest URL.
	   Change the return type to a const string.

	ID-WSF 2.0: add a method to retrieve/create a SOAP Fault to SOAP binding module
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/soap_binding.{c,h}:
	   add method lasso_soap_envelope_get_soap_fault which returns/create
	   the first SOAP fault inside the body of the SOAP envelope.

	Binding python tests: adapt test to use TOP_SRCDIR env var

	Binding python: factorize value freeing generation code
	 * lasso/python/lang.py:
	   extract value freeing generation code to method free_value,
	   add proper liberation of values at exit of wrapper functions, remove
	   g_free call from return_value generated code.

	Core: add missing return value owner semantic annotations to getters
	 * lasso/id-ff/provider.c:
	   fix lasso_provider_get_base64_succinct_id, it returned a libxml
	   string, copy it with g_strdup before releasing it to stay with GLib
	   allocated string in return values.

	Core: add annotation to getter function about return value owner semantic
	 * lasso/id-ff/identity.c lasso/id-ff/profile.c:
	   precise owner semantic of lasso_profile_get_identity,
	   lasso_profile_get_session, lasso_profile_get_server
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/saml2_login.c tests/login_tests_saml2.c:
	   in the same vein add missing release of assertion returned by
	   lasso_login_get_assertion which return a caller owned object.

	ID-WSF 2.0: make lasso_idwsf2_profile_redirect_user_for_interaction choke on missing redirect property on UserInteraction header
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/profile.c:
	   if redirect boolean property is false, refuse to return a redirect
	   request.
	   automatically create a SOAP fault to signal to the requester that it
	   needs to support interaction via redirect.

	ID-WSF 2.0: add error code signaling that the requester does not support redirect request
	 * lasso/errors.c lasso/errors.h:
	   add
	   LASSO_WSF_PROFILE_ERROR_REDIRECT_REQUEST_UNSUPPORTED_BY_REQUESTER.

	ID-WSF 2.0: add a create arg to lasso_soap_envelope_get_sb2_user_interaction_header, add it to public API

	ID-WSF 2.0: fix lots of bad usage of g_strcmp0
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/idwsf2_helper.c lasso/id-wsf-2.0/soap_binding.c
	   lasso/id-wsf/data_service.:
	   add missing check for the return value of strcmp, maybe we need a
	   macro like lasso_strequal.

	Tests: in login_tests_saml2.c, add test for lasso_saml2_assertion_validate_conditions

	in idwsf2_tests.py, merge test case for metadata registering, add test case for failure

	Bindings: parse defines refering to other defines
	 * bindings/bindings.py:
	   Allow to build constants using other constants (prefix string), the
	   constant type is retrieved from the prefix existing record.

	in tools.c, add defines to permit import of timegm

	SAML 2.0: make lasso_saml2_assertion_validate_conditions really work

	Core: fix lasso_iso_8601_gmt_to_time_t, use timegm instead of mktime
	 * lasso/xml/tools.c:
	   mktime convert works on local time, we need timegm to work with GMT
	   time.

	ID-WSF 2.0: add strings for Discovery service Actions

	ID-WSF 2.0: add serialization code for private properties of LassoIdWsf2Profile

	ID-WSF 2.0: fix missing initialization of request field in lasso_idwsf2_discovery_validate_md_register

	ID-WSF 2.0: fix lasso_idwsf2_discovery_add_simple_service_metadata
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/discovery.c:
	   options is a string list, and security_mech_ids too, so employ the
	   corresponding macros.

	Core: in utils.h, use a temporary to store reference to freed list

	ID-WSF 2.0: in lasso_idwsf2_discovery_status2rc, check second level status code too

	Website: add a link to the developement version documentation

2010-02-15  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Binding python: fix leak in string getters

	SAML 2.0: fix documentation of lasso_saml2_assertion_validate_conditions

	Add signature on EPR secur token

	Bindings python: udpate id-wsf 2.0 test file
	 * bindings/python/tests/idwsf2_tests.py:
	   Disco Service registering is working, it now needs a bootstrap epr in
	   all case (before registering could be done without signatures).

	ID-WSF 2.0: add signature to Disco produced EPR SAML 2.0 security tokens

	ID-WSF 2.0: in lasso_idwsf2_profile_build_request_msg, properly handle the security token
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/profile.c:
	   security token is a signed assertion by an IdP or a discovery
	   service, we must keep as is, that is with the signature, in order to
	   do that we extract the original xmlNode from the assertion and embed
	   it in the new message using a LassoMiscTextNode.

	ID-WSF 2.0: in lasso_login_idwsf2_get_discovery_bootstrap_epr, better handle attribute content
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/saml2_login.c:
	   LassoSaml2AttributeValue can contain many children, so traverse them
	   all to find the firs LassoWsAddrEndpointReference among them.

	ID-WSF 2.0: in lasso_login_idwsf2_add_discovery_bootstrap_epr, initialize ID and Issuer property on bootstrap assertion.
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/saml2_login.c:
	   initialization of ID and Issuer properties was missing.

	Core: in lasso_verify_signature, fix conditional about single reference
	 * lasso/xml/toosl.c:
	   verify that reference is unique if NO_SINGLE_REFERENCE is disabled.

	   add missing initialization code.

	ID-WSF 2.0: fix bad type checking in lasso_wsa_endpoint_reference_get_idwsf2_security_context_for_security_mechanism
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/idwsf2_helper.c:
	   SecurityMechID is a list of strings not LassoMiscTextNode.

	ID-WSF 2.0: fix bad conditionnal in lasso_idwsf2_discovery_process_metadata_register_response_msg
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/discovery.c:
	   fix check in
	   lasso_idwsf2_discovery_process_metadata_register_response_msg
	   fix duplication of service metadatas inside private list of service
	   metadatas.

	in server.c, fix missing loading of public keys in constructors
	 * lasso/id-ff/server.c:
	   constructor for LassoProvider load public keys but they are not
	   called by LassoServer constructors, so we have to explicitely
	   duplicate calls to lasso_provider_load_public_keys.

	ID-WSF 2.0: moved strings to their own header

2010-02-12  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Add saml2_strings.h to dist

	Bindings python: remove default argument if there is parameters without default argument following

	Use defined symbols instead of magic constants

	Add LASSO_SAML2_FIELD_ENCODING
	 * lasso/xml/saml-2.0/saml2_strings.h:
	   add another field name from SAML 2.0 specifications.

	Fix lasso_get_relaystate_from_query, support semi-colon and parameter at beginning
	* lasso/xml/tools.c:
	  getting first parameter was broken (query_string does not contain '?'
	  at the beginning) and semi-colon support was missing.

2010-02-10  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Documentation: fix typos in saml2_strings.h documentation, add new string symbols to lasso-sections.txt

	   move them here, document useful ones.

	Documentation: document LsasoSamlp2NameIDPolicy

	Documentation: complete non finished documentation comments
	 * too much warnings when generating doc, now we can concentrate on
	   undocumented symbols (in
	   lasso/docs/reference/lasso/lasso-undocumented.txt).

	Bindings perl: prevent unused functio warning for array_to_glist_gobject

	Tests perl: raise number of tests

	Docs: reorder sections in chapter "Lasso Architecture"

	SAML 2.0: separate lasso_saml20_login_process_response_status_and_assertion into multiple functions
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/login.c:
	   in lasso_saml20_login_process_response_status_and_assertion, extract assertion
	   decryption, and issuer checking into their own function.

	SAML 2.0: when verifying query signature, do not presume order of field and separator
	 * lasso/xml/tools.c:
	   in lasso_saml2_verify_query_signature, extract needed field and order
	   them appropriately before computing digest, expect ';' as well as '&'
	   as separator.
	 * tests/random_test.c:
	   add non-regression tests for query signature validation.
	 * tests/Makefile.am:
	   make tests link agains static version of liblasso, to get access to

	   - in lasso_saml20_login_process_authn_response_msg keep around all error
	     codes returned by intermediary steps. At the end report the first one.

	SAML 2.0: in lasso_saml20_profile_process_any_response do not stop on missing issuer
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/profile.c:
	   Issuer is not a mandatory element of SAML 2.0 response,
	   but if we do not remember which issuer we sent the request (of if
	   the response is spontaneous) then we will receive a provider not found
	   error when trying to check the message signature.

	Use new SAML2 strings instead of hardcoding query string field names

	Add documentation about runtime flags
	 * lasso/lasso.c:
	   add a table to Initialization documentation section about
	   general runtime flags.

	Remove follow-idwsf-stupid-semantic flag

	- update documentation of LASSO_SERVER_ERROR_PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND,
	LASSO_SERVER_ERROR_ADD_PROVIDER_PROTOCOL_MISMATCH,

	* lasso/build_strerror.py:
	before outputting switch cases, order error codes
	name lexically in order to reduce change lines
	when adding new error codes.

2010-02-10  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Add strings for SAML2 field names for POST, Redirect and Artifact bindings

	Update documentation of the registry module

	Adapt LassoProvider methods to care for protocol profile version when verifying signature
	 * lasso/id-ff/provider.c:
	   there is now 2 methods to verify signatures, methods calling the old
	   one must now choose whether to call the liberty one of the SAML 2.0
	   one.

	Add a function to validate query signatures using SAML 2.0 semantic
	 * lasso/xml/tools.c:
	   this new function is a placeholder for the new SAML 2.0 semantic
	   following query signature validation function. It will start with the
	   old code of lasso_query_verify_signature.

	Propagate change of name for LASSO_PP_ defines

2010-02-08  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core: in LassoServer constructors, test if private_key is loadable
	 * lasso/id-ff/server.c:
	   mark private_key as not mandatory as regression tests expect it to
	   not be mandatory.
	   test if loading of private key to encryption_private_key private
	   field worked, if not abort the constructor and return NULL.
	 * lasso/id-ff/server.h:
	   fix name of constructors argument to corresponds with comments
	   (binding generator use this correspondance to apply annotation from
	   comments to the model obtained by parsing the headers).

	in lasso_xmlsec_load_private_key_from_buffer, do not let xmlSecBase64Decode show warnings

2010-02-05  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	fix bad operation in bindings.py

2010-02-04  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Bindings: restore ID-WSF constants, improve python getters,
	 * bindings/bindings.py:
	   parse idwsf_strings.h to get ID-WSF constants.
	 * bindings/utils.py:
	   add an is_rc check function, to check for 'error code' return type.
	 * bindings/perl/lang.py:
	   only raise errors for 'int' or 'gint' return type
	 * bindings/python/lang.py:
	   - always create a normal function binding.
	   - for functions starting with 'get' try to create a corresponding
	     property, but if a corresponding member already exists, fails, and
	     print a warning about getter function/member field clash.
	   - make type dispatching on return_type more explicite.

	Core: Finish support for all XMLDsig key formats
	 * lasso/xml/tools.c:
	   xmlsec is not able to load a certificate public key without checking
	   it against trusted root certificate, so we must work around and load
	   the key by hand.
	   lasso_xmlsec_load_private_key_from_buffer is made more robust in the
	   same (loading of the key was extracted inside
	   _lasso_xmlsec_load_key_from_buffer) and now can load certificates and
	   keys directly embedded inside KeyValue nodes (in total opposition to
	   the XMLDsig specification but...), with or without PEM headers.
	 * tests/metadata/Makefile.am tests/metadata/metadata_06.xml
	   tests/metadata_tests.c:
	   add test case for RSAKeyValue public keys.

	Binding python: fix getter for non-object fields
	 * bindings/python/lang.py:
	   transition to bindings/utils.py methods broke getters.

	Core: in lasso_xmlsec_load_key_info add flag to let xmlSec load certificates
	 * lasso/xml/tools.c:
	   adding the flag XMLSEC_KEYINFO_FLAGS_X509DATA_DONT_VERIFY_CERTS make
	   xmlSec able to load certificate, the 'hand made' code to load
	   certificate is then useless.

	Tests: add more checking to dump generation code in login_tests.c

	Tests: adapt server constructor settings to recent changes

	Core: in lasso_profile_get_request_type_from_soap_msg use lasso_xml_parse_memory_with_error
	 * lasso/id-ff/profile.c: (lasso_profile_get_request_type_from_soap_msg)
	   use lasso_xml_parse_memory_with_error instead of xmlParseMemory, use
	   error code output argument to log error reports.

	Core: in provider.c, make lasso_provider_load_metadata_from_buffer the main metadata loading function
	 * (init_from_xml) fail initialization if we cannot load the metadatas,
	   and log a warning.
	 * extract _lasso_provider_load_metadata_from_buffer from
	   lasso_provider_load_metadata_from_buffer, which accept a length
	   parameter. use it inside lasso_provider_load_metadata, instead of
	   xmlParseFile.
	 * (lasso_provider_load_public_key) use lasso_xmlsec_load_key_info and
	   lasso_xmlsec_load_private_key to load the public keys.

	Core: use lasso_xml_parse_file to load affiliation file

	Binding java: Makefile.am has multiple target rules, it cannot support parallel builds

	Core: in tools.c, add function to load XML files and KeyInfo nodes
	 * tools.c:
	   add lasso_xml_parse_file, based on g_file_get_contents and
	   lasso_xml_parse_memory.
	   add lasso_xml_parse_memory_with_error which instead of logging
	   errors, can return the xmlError structure.
	   add lasso_xmlsec_load_key_info, which allows to load keys from
	   ds:KeyInfo XML nodes. It also support the "Lasso" bug of using
	   ds:KeyValue directly to store base64 encoded keys and certificates.

	SAML 2.0: in name_id_management.c, rework lasso_name_id_management_new_from_dump

	Core: add more memory tracing, add a tracing macro
	 * lasso/utils.h: add lasso_trace, which as a printf signature.
	 * xml/xml.c: add more trace to node initialization code.

	Tests: in valgrind suppressions file add more GLib suppressions

	Tests: in basic_tests.c, re-enable parsing of LassoWsuTimestamp objects

	Core: use lasso_node_new_from_dump to implement _new_from_dump methods
	 * provider.c:
	   add annotation for nullable arguments (necessary for bindings of
	   new_from_buffer).
	 * server.c: add annotations, allow to set encryption_private_key from
	   buffers

	Binding perl: add cleanup for temporary data of trampoline code
	 * bindings/perl/lang.py:
	   data type not common to Perl and C must be allocated for the duration
	   of the call (mainly GList and xmlNode), but after the call they must
	   be deallocated.

	SAML 2.0: in samlp2_response.c, simplify code path for assertion encryption

	Fix leaks
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/profile.c: release private data object.
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/login.c: free NameID content after construction.
	 * lasso/xml/tools.c: free algorithm attribute content in
	   lasso_node_decrypt_xmlnode.
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c: release cutom_element->nodename in destructor.
	   remove useless finalize method.
	 * tests/basic_tests.c: release xmldoc after use.
	 * tests/random_tests.c: free resut of lasso_node_dump.

	Fix leaks, change signature of lasso_provider_get_sp_name_qualifier, make it return a const char*

	in lasso/xml/tools.c, remove leaks of xmlSecKey and xmlNode

	in lasso_xmlsec_load_private_key, do not leak the file buffer, in lasso_node_encrypt do not leak the keys manager

2010-02-01  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Binding perl: many improvements
	 * lang.py: use lasso_unref instead of g_object_unref.
	 * lang.py: handle 'optional' annotation for more types, needed by
	   ID-WSF bindings.
	 * lang.py, gobject_handling.c: check object type before making the C
	   call
	 * Makefile.am: improve silent rules, hide all normal output, show
	   errors, and with V=1 shows everything
	 * glist_handling.c, gobject_handling.c: make local functions static
	 * t/Lasso.t: add non regression test for method receiver type checking.
	 * glist_handlind.c; remove unused convertion functions.
	 * lang.py: clear the semi-assigned list and croak if all list elements
	   do not convert to non-NULL values.

	Bindings: re-add binding for lasso_session_get_assertions for perl, special case formatting function for WsAddressing namespace
	 * bindings/utils.py:
	   type have LassoWsAddr prefix but function have the lasso_wsa_ prefix,
	   so we have to adjust generated prefix.

	Bindings: use lasso_return_xxx macros instead of GLib ones

	ID-WSF: remove useless new_from_message methods

	Core: in utils.h, add macros to replace verbose g_return_val_if_fail

	Core: document return values of lasso_login_validate_request_msg

	Utils: lasso_unref, a safe g_object_unref, and add some document about existing family of macros

	Core: do not emit messages inside lasso_check_version

	Bindings: os.path.relpath is only present since python 2.6, add a local implementation for older python versions

	Add a dist-hook to remove .svn directories before taring the dist

	Bindings: make binding generation more silent
	 * bindings/java/Makefile.am bindings/perl/Makefile.am
	   bindings/php5/Makefile.am bindings/python/Makefile.am:
	   use AM_V_GEN, or similar variable for all steps of binding
	   generation, normal output can be activated with the V=1 argument to
	   the 'make' command.

	Binding java: use eager evalutation to get list of sources files
	 * bindings/java/Makefile.am:
	   use := to provoke eager evaluation so that java-list mode is not
	   called many times.

2010-01-29  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Bindings: use 'absolute' header paths to produces bindings
	 * bindings/bindings.py:
	   if files from bindings are using absolute instead of relatives header
	   paths they can be independant of the lasso source.

	Bindings perl: simplify Makefile.PL
	 * bindings/perl/Makefile.PL:
	   remove as much special casing as possible so that it could eventually
	   become a CPAN module.
	   use pkg-config to find lasso libs if no explicit LIBS command line
	   argument is used.
	 * bindings/perl/Makefile.am:
	   pass parameters using command line argument instead of environment
	   variable, which needed a special Makefile.PL.

	Binding perl: special case for lasso_check_version
	 * bindings/perl/lang.py:
	   special case lasso_check_version for not raising an error when it
	   returns 1.
	 * bindings/perl/t/Lasso.t:
	   add a non regression test.

	Binding perl: remove warning when passing Null to croak
	 * bindings/perl/gobject_handling.c:
	   croak is aliased to Perl_croak_nocontext which has a gcc attribute
	   'notnull'. We use Perl_croak and an explicit perl context object, to
	   work around this warning.

	in bindings.py, change header paths

	Update files for a 2.2.91 release

	update changelog

	Binding python: make a better use of default value annotation for creating method declarations

	Binding perl: many improvements
	 * handle GHashTable of strings and objects.
	 * report errors with 'croak' as a Lasso::Error object.
	 * add more basic tests.
	 * for string arguments, convert undef to NULL, and croak if function
	   does not accept NULL.
	 * fix library paths in Makefile.PL.

	Bindings: in bindings.py, fix regexp and annotation parsing for optional arguments and their default values

	SAML 2.0: fix annotations, documentation and signatures

2010-01-28  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Bindings python ID-WSF 1.0 tests: update PP HREF symbol

	Bindings php5: string hashtable methods are only used by ID-WSF bindings, mark them unused by default
	 * bindings/php5/wrapper_source_top.c:
	   only id-wsf has field of type GHashtTable<char*,char*> so when
	   compiling without --enable-wsf, it give 'unused symbols' errors.
	   Lets mark de the concerned functions as unused.

	ID-WSF 1.0: make LassoServer.services private with respect to the bindings

	Bindings java: use utils.py methods, make set_hash_of_objects more robust

	Tests: export sp2-la do dist file for dist with id-wsf enabled

	Bindings: add time_t to integer types, add unpointerize method

	Binding python ID-WSF 2.0 tests: update some tests

	Binding Python ID-WSF 2.0: comment out test

	ID-WSF: change name of Personal Profile namespace symbols, add symbols for ID-SIS PP 1.1

	Bindings: java, php5, python simplify logic in binding generator
	 * use utils.h macros to manipulate fields.
	 * use utils.py function to filter variables, argument and return types.
	 * finish support of hashtables of strings for php5 and python.

	Bindings: better parse oftype annotation for hashtable, allow to skip structures
	 * bindings/bindings.py:
	   add possibility to skip generating bindings for structures to
	   overrides.xml.
	   parse element-type annotation /* of XXX */ for hashtable objects.
	   output to stderr warning about skipped objects.
	   parse idwsf_strings.h

2010-01-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	ID-WSF 1.0 & 2.0: complete lasso-sections.txt, add internal API to access SOAP headers, complete WS-Addressing support
	 * docs/reference/lasso/lasso-sections.txt: complete documentation of
	   LassoSoapEnvelope and LassoSoapFault with ID-WSF additions.

2010-01-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core XML: make lasso_node_set_custom_namespace/nodename take const string
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c lasso/xml/xml.h:
	   mark argument of lasso_node_set_custom_namespace and
	   lasso_node_set_custom_nodename as const char* strings.

	Core XML: add function to get the namespace of a LassoNode
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c lasso/xml/xml.h:
	   if a custome namespace is set, return it, otherwise return the class
	   namespace (klass->node_data->ns->href).

	Binding perl: fix include paths in the makefile, again

	in bindings/perl/Makefile.PL, add include path for normal builds

	in configure.ac, activate the Perl binding in normal builds

	Core: in configure.ac, activate warning when debugging, not in normal build
	 * configure.ac:
	   remove -Wxxx flag from AM_CFLAGS, add them if --enable-debugging
	   is used.

	in lasso/saml-2.0/logout.c, fix missing declaration

	Core: update errors.c file

	in bindings/perl/Makefile.am, change permission to make distcheck works

	in bindings/perl/Makefile.am, add files to EXTRA_DIST

2010-01-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Bindings: add a new perl binding using the new binding infrastructure
	 * XS files is autogenerated using bindings/binding.py model of the
	   Lasso API. All constants are in the Lasso::Constants package, the
	   LASSO_ prefix is removed.
	   All classes are now Lasso::ClassName, field accessor also serves as
	   setters, i.e you can do this:
	   $name_id = Lasso::Saml2NameID::new();
	   $name_id->content('coin');
	   print $name_id->content;

	   Is still missing:
	    - a lot of test files,
	    - support for hashtables,
	    - and throwing exceptions when return code is non-zero.

2010-01-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Bindings: in utils.py, fix is_glist and is_hashtable, make arg_type accept simple string as input instead of triples

	in lasso/xml/saml_attribute_value.h, fix typo in content type annotation

	in lasso/xml/sa_sasl_response.h, add GList content type annotation to field 'any'

	Bindings PHP5: use is_cstring to match string types

	Bindings: remove all SWIG bindings and SWIG related files

	Add new macro lasso_list_add_new_xml_node
	 * lasso/utils.h:
	   fix lasso_list_add_xml_node, it must copy the node before assigning
	   it.
	   add lasso_list_add_new_xml_node for keeping the old behaviour.
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   fix use of lasso_list_add_xml_node, because copying the node before
	   assigning it is a leak now.

2010-01-25  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	in bindings/ghashtable.h, Add missing unused argument hints

	SAML 2.0 Logout: when in an SP initiated logout, lasso_logout_build_response_msg is the finishing call
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/logout.c:
	   when calling lasso_logout_build_response_msg(), if we known that we
	   are in the middle of an SP initiated logout, i.e. if
	   initial_remote_providerID is not NULL, then we can restore the intial
	   response.

	Fix name of LASSO_WSSEC_BAD_PASSWORD
	 * lasso/errors.c lasso/errors.h:
	   LASSO_WSSE_BAD_PASSWORD -> LASSO_WSSEC_ERROR_BAD_PASSWORD
	 * lasso/xml/ws/wsse_username_token.c:
	   update client code.

	Bindings java: cast return value of special constructors
	 * bindings/java/lang.py:
	   in the JAVA API special constructors are made to return their real
	   type, but usual GObject constructors return their base type (here
	   LassoNode) so we have to cast it.

	Export more assertion access API for LassoSession
	 * lasso/id-ff/session.c lasso/id-ff/session.h
	   lasso/id-ff/sessionprivate.h:
	   export lasso_session_get_assertion(), lasso_session_add_assertion()
	   and lasso_session_remove_assertion().
	   remove them from private header.
	 * docs/reference/lasso/lasso-sections.txt:
	   update documentation

2010-01-21  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Bindings: remove useless overrides
	 * bindings/overrides.xml:
	   It is no more needed to force return type of constructors to their
	   real types, the bindings check the type dynamically anyway.

	Fix GHashTable backward compatibility header
	 * lasso/ghashtable.h:
	   g_hash_table_remove_all_nodes is not a public function, use
	   g_hash_table_foreach_remove instead.

2010-01-20  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	in saml2_name_id.c, include utils.h to benefit from replacement for g_strcmp0

2010-01-19  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	ID-WSF 2.0: add some annotations

	Core: in backward_comp.h, include string.h if g_strcmp0 is used
	 * lasso/backward_comp.h:
	   implementation of g_strcmp0 depends upon string.h.

	WS-Security: fix typo in name of string symbols
	 * lasso/xml/idwsf_strings.h:
	   uppercase define for WS-Securities SOAP faults.

	WS: complete support for wsse:UsernameToken

	   add new functions and change type name in documentation.
	 * lasso/errors.h lasso/errors.c:
	   add an error to report password verification failure
	 * lasso/xml/ws/wsse_username_token.h
	   lasso/xml/ws/wsse_username_token.c:
	   update support for wsse:UsernameToken up to version 1.1, implement
	   digest and derived keys computations.
	 * lasso/xml/idwsf_strings.h:
	   add strings for Username WS-Security Token profile

	XML SAML-2.0: AuthnContext content is a xdf:choice so make content optional
	 - lasso/xml/saml-2.0/saml2_authn_context.c:
	   <AuthnContext/> can contain at least one node among:
	    - <AuthnContextClassRef/>
	    - <AuthnContextDeclRef/>
	    - <AuthnContextDecl/>
	   to approximate this possibility, we need to make any of them
	   optional.
	   <AuthenticatingAuthority/> should be a list but we cannot change it
	   without breaking the ABI, so we will wait for this.

	make an explicit copy of lasso.doap to website/web/doap.rdf

2010-01-14  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	SAML 2.0 Logout: undo some change to when the assertion is removed
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/logout.c:
	   - do not remove the assertion in init_request, as before only if all
	     fails (event REDIRECT is unsupported).
	   - in process_response_msg remove the assertion if we are the IdP or
	     if there is no error.
	   - in validate_request, remove the assertion if there is no error.

	   I think that there will be more updates to this in the future.

2010-01-14  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Bindings: make is_cstring usable with tuple and with direct type

	in saml-2.0/name_id_management.c: handle NewEncryptedID, only encrypt if needed

	in saml-2.0/logout.c: remove commented code, only encrypt if needed, intialize local variables

	in lasso_saml20_login_init_idp_initiated_auhtn_request, do not use init_authn_request, manually create the request.

	in lasso_saml20_login_init_authn_request,  use saml-2.0/profile.c functions to reduce code size

	in saml-2.0/profile.c, in lasso_saml20_profile_init_response make direct access

	in saml-2.0/profile.c, in lasso_saml20_init_request better check for supported bindings,  do not check for identity or session, report SESSION_NOT_FOUND only if first_in_session is used, do not stop on missing name_id.

	in saml2_helper.c, remove dead code

	SAML 2.0: in lasso_saml20_provider_accept_http_method, add HTTP-Artifact-POST case, better check for bad inputs, and handle special SingleSignOn case

	     the node, so that the normal behaviour of the serialization is kept
	     -- i.e. do not play with the list of parent classes.

	   - use the full xsi:type content to find a LassoNode subclass when
	     de-serializaing XML content, factorize QName->GObject class mapping
	     for the three executions paths inside
	     _type_name_from_href_and_nodename:
	      - element QName,
	      - xsi:type QName,
	      - element name with xsi:type namespace
	   - add a long comment expliciting the way the mapping is done.
	   - remove direct mapping of EncryptedAssertion element, the registry

	Bindings python: in wrapper_top.c, mark internal function as potentially unused

2010-01-04  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Bindings: make the binding infrastructure understand GObject-introspections annotations
	 * bindings/bindings.py
	 * bindings/utils.py:
	   add convenience function to treat arguments tuple:
	   (type,name,{annotations}).
	   introduce new argument options, fix that arguments are 3-tuple of the
	   form (type,name,annotations), where annotations is a dictionary.
	   Key of this dictionnary can be:
	    - optional, wheter the argument is necessary, it means it has a
	      default value.
	    - out, means that the pointer is a pointer of pointer, for bindings
	      that can return exceptions, it will be returned instead of the
	      integer error code, the only way to access error codes will be
	      exceptions.
	    - element-type, contained type of a list or an array,
	    - key-type, value-type, type of respectively the key and value of a
	      GHashTable.
	    - transfer, wheter a the callee(for arguments)/caller(for return
	      values) owns the values passed, it can be none,container(if the
	      callee/caller only owns the container not the contained value) or
	      full.

	    attribute-annotations is a string of the form '(option1)(option2
	    option-arguments) etc.'.
	   - add predicates for xml, list and time_t values. improve predicates
	     for cstring and const modifier.

	*  bindings/overrides.xml:
	    'out' arguments are not well supported for java, so skip functions
	    using them.

	 *  bindings/java/lang.py bindings/php5/php_code.py
	    bindings/php5/wrapper_source.py bindings/python/lang.py:
	    - update language specifig binding generators for handling new
	      annotations.
	    - improve python method declaration, handle optional arguments with
	      default values, factorize this chode in two methods,
	      get_python_arg_decl and defval_to_python_value.

	 *  bindings/python/tests/Makefile.am
	    bindings/python/tests/idwsf1_tests.py

2009-12-16  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core: in utils.h, change __STRING(x) for #x
	 * lasso/utils.h:

	Fix reporting of error in message parsing
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   do not mix the return code from xmlSecBase64Decode and the return
	   code for lasso_node_init_from_message_with_format.
	   It fixes a segmentation fault in
	   lasso_login_process_authn_request_msg.

2009-10-30  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core: factorize code to obtain a SPNameQualifier
	 * lasso/id-ff/provider.c lasso/id-ff/provider.h:

	   update use sites.

2009-10-30  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Make php4 and perl binding disabled by default
	 * configure.ac:
	   make default for --enable-perl and --enable-php4 to "no". Those
	   binding will not be maintained in the future.

	SAML2 Logout: initialize SessionIndex from the assertion
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/logout.c:
	   when creating a logout request message initialize the SessionIndex
	   element with the correponding content in the stored assertion for
	   this session.

	Tests: fix __FILE__ -> __file__
	 * tests/integration/saml2/__init__.py:
	   path to the current python file is __file__ not __FILE__.

	SAML2: change lasso_saml20_profile_set_response_status signature
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/profile.c:
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/profileprivate.h:
	   make lasso_saml20_profile_set_response_status2 the new implementation
	   of lasso_saml20_profile_set_response_status.

	   add a lasso_saml2_name_id_equals method which return TRUE if two
	   NameId are equal.

	SAML2: use the static get_provider helper method in generic profile methods
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/profile.c:
	   instead of accessing directly profile->server use the helper method
	   get_provider.

	SAML2: in logout_build_response_msg do not fail on missing remote_providerID
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/logout.c:
	   remote_providerId is verified in build_redirect_simple and is not
	   necessary for SOAP response with a failure and profile->response
	   cannot be null (we just created a response if it was missing).
	   So this error case is now unnecessary.

	ID-FF1.2 and SAML2: remove direct access to profile->server->providers
	 * client of LassoServer should use lasso_server_get_provider.
	 * LASSO_PROFILE_ERRROR_UNKNOWN_PROVIDER was a mistake, it is
	   superfluous, use LASSO_SERVER_ERROR_PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND.

	Core: in profile, use lasso_server_get_provider
	 - lasso/id-ff/profile.c:
	   replace direct access to server->provider by
	   lasso_server_get_provider.

2009-09-29  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Tests: add a test of NameIDFormat extraction
	 - tests/basic_test.c:

	   try to extract the default name id format.
	 - tests/data/sp5-saml2/metadata.xml:
	   add NameIDFormat node for testing.

	Core: add const modifier to return value of lasso_provider_get_metadata_list
	 - lasso/id-ff/provider.c lasso/id-ff/provider.h:
	   change return type of lasso_provider_get_metadata_list from GList* to
	   const GList*.
	 - lasso/id-ff/logout.c lasso/saml-2.0/logout.c
	   lasso/saml-2.0/provider.c:
	   change consumers of the API

	Core: Add const modifiers to LassoProvider methods
	 * lasso/id-ff/provider.c lasso/id-ff/provider.h
	   lasso/saml-2.0/provider.c lasso/saml-2.0/provider.h:
	   add const modifier where they could be added.

	Do not use g_new, use g_new0
	 * lasso/id-ff/federation.c:
	 * lasso/id-ff/logout.c:
	 * lasso/id-ff/profile.c:
	 * lasso/id-ff/provider.c:
	 * lasso/id-ff/server.c:
	 * lasso/id-ff/session.c:
	 * lasso/id-wsf/authentication.c:
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/ecp.c:
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   even for private datas, use g_new0, it is safer.

	Change setting of default NameIDFormat for SAML 2.0 login
	 * saml-2.0/login.c:
	   in lasso_saml20_login_init_authn_request,
	   lasso_saml20_login_init_idp_initiated_authn_request, if the service
	   provider provided a list of supported name id formats, use the first
	   one as default for new AuthnRequest.
	 * id-ff/login.c:
	   modify documentation to report the new way of choosing a default.

	Add method to Provider to retrieve default NameIDFormat
	 * lasso/id-ff/provider.c lasso/id-ff/provider.h:
	   add lasso_provider_get_default_name_id_format, which returns the firs
	   listed NameIDFormat from the SAML 2.0 metadatas of the provider.

	Complete documentation of lasso_login_init_authn_request concerning the NameIDFormat
	 * lasso/id-ff/login.c:
	   in lasso_login_init_authn_request, add docbook formatting, add
	   remarks about the different NameIDFormat for ID-FF 1.2 and SAML 2.0.

2009-09-17  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Fix bugs found via coverity (thanks to Bhaskar Jain)

	   in get_xmlNode.
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/login.c:
	   in lasso_saml20_login_accept_sso check for ni and ni->Format
	   null-ness before dereferencing, remove idp_ni which is not used
	   anymore.
	   remote all use of federation->remote_nameIdentifier, SAML 2.0 only
	   need one NameID, and it will be local_nameIdentifier.
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   in lasso_node_traversal, check null-ness of node before dereferencing
	   it, add check for class null-ness also.
	 * lasso/id-ff/provider.c:
	   in lasso_provider_get_first_http_method, remove useless check for t2
	   null-ness -- if found is TRUE, t1 and t2 cannot be null.
	 * lasso/xml/tools.c:
	   in lasso_sign_node, add documentation, check for private_key_file and
	   xmlnode null-ness.
	   in lasso_get_public_key_from_private_key_file, add a cleanup phase,
	   check for cert variabl null-ness befor appending, count the number of
	   certificates added.
	   in lasso_query_verify_signature, check that URL unescaping and base64
	   decoding are succesfull before using the decoded strings.
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/name_id_management.c:
	   in lasso_name_id_management_validate_request, fix mis-handling of
	   federation, if federation does not match request name_id, return
	   UNKNOWN_PRINCIPAL.

	ID-WSF: finish unsealing field « is_dirty » of LassoSession
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/session.c:
	   remove direct acces to LassoSession private field.

2009-09-11  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core: unseal LassoSession public field
	 * lasso/id-ff/session.c:
	 * lasso/id-ff/session.h:
	 * lasso/id-ff/sessionprivate.h:
	   unseal session->is_dirty and session->assertions, remove the mirror
	   version in the private data structure, and restore direct acces by
	   methods.
	   move the "private" comment before those two fields to hide them in
	   the gtk-doc reference manual, normal access should be done by
	   get_assertion and is_dirty methods.

2009-09-11  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	XML ID-WSF: Fix parsing of most ID-WSF elements
	 * lasso/xml/disco_send_single_logout.c:
	 * lasso/xml/id-wsf-2.0/sb2_user_interaction_header.c:
	 * lasso/xml/id-wsf-2.0/subsref_app_data.c:
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   lots of ID-WSF 1.0/2.0 classes were not passing the new
	   non-regression test on serialization/deserialization.
	   The main reason was the absence of mapping for their namespace in the
	   prefix_from_href_and_nodename function. The other reason is that some
	   class name does not correspond 1-to-1 to the element name
	   (SendSingleLogOut vs. SendSingleLogout, notice the capitalised 'O').

	   The last problem was that mapping from nodes to GObject classes was
	   done after default mapping ("Lasso<prefix><node_name>"), now it's
	   done before, to reflect the fact that it is a more specialized
	   mapping.

2009-09-11  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core: remove warning when lasso_registry_get_direct_mapping fails
	 * lasso/registry.c (lasso_registry_get_direct_mapping):
	  g_return_val_if_fail output a warning when condition fails, use a
	  simple if instead.

	Tests: add more assertion to random test
	 * tests/random_tests.c:
	   add more assertion testing for various return values or field values.

	XML: Fix seg-fault bug introduced in commit 4108
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   lasso_node_get_xmlnode_for_any_type is broken, if no original_xmlnode
	   is present, return just cur. Also add all missing cases for the state
	   of the pair (cur, orignal_xmlnode).
	 * tests/basic_tests.c:
	   add a non-regression test, testing all dump/restore functions.

	Core: add new macros to traverse lists
	 * lasso/utils.h:
	   lasso_foreach_full_begin(_type, _data, _iter, _list)
	   traverse GList* _list, using _iter as iteration variable
	   extract data field to variable _data of type _type.

	Test: fix Makefile.am to work with 'out of source' build directory
	 * tests/Makefile.am:
	   rpath must refer to the build directory, not the source directory.

	Core: fix extract_symbols regular expression
	 * lasso/extract_symbols.py:
	   the regular expression was not matching declaration over multiple lines,
	   and would catch argument starting with lasso_. Fixed.

	XML: add all inclusive header files for id-wsf2, ws, id-wsf XML elements
	 * lasso/xml/wsf/xml_ws.h:
	 * lasso/xml/id-wsf-2.0/xml_idwsf2.h:
	 * lasso/xml/xml_idwsf.h:
	   new files.

	ID-WSF 2.0: add set_request/set_response method to Profile object
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/profile.c:
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/profile.h:
	   add two methods that set the response object and replace the content
	   of the SOAP message with this object.

	XML SOAP: add new soap fault constructor
	 * lasso/xml/soap_fault.c:
	 * lasso/xml/soap_fault.h:
	   add a full constructor allowing to set faultcode and faultstring in
	   one call.

	XML ID-WSF 2.0: make non simple constructor of MiscTextNode return real type
	 * lasso/xml/misc_text_node.c:
	   non simple constructor must return the real object type because Java
	   binding does not work without it.

	XML SAML 1.1: fix schema figure for samlp:Request

	Docs: remove old lasso-sections.txt file

	ID-WSF 2.0: add accessor for field of LassoIdWsf2Profile
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/profile.c lasso/id-wsf-2.0/profile.c:
	   add two accessor to get to soap_response and soap_request object,
	   next step is to make those two fields really private.

	ID-WSF: fix duplication of namespace string declaration, add fault codes for WS-Security
	 * lasso/xml/strings.h:
	   namespace of WS-Security 1.0 was duplicated,
	   add specified fault code linked to WS-Security.

	ID-WSF: remove LassoWsseSecurity in favor of LasoWsSec1SecurityHeader
	 * xml/Makefile.am:
	   remove the file from the source list
	 * xml/wsse_security.c:
	 * xml/wsse_security.h:
	   remove the files
	 * xml/xml.c:
	   use LassoWsSec1SecurityHeader for LASSO_WSSE_HREF namespace also.

	ID-WSF 1.0: use the common wsse:Security object
	 * lasso/id-wsf/wsf_profile.c:
	   use the common LassoWsSec1SecurityHeader object instead of the
	   specific LassoWsseSecurity, and set the needed namespace using
	   lasso_node_set_custom_namespace.
	   add implementation comments.

	WS: register LassoWsSec1SecurityHeader for all namespace associated to WS-Security
	 * lasso/xml/ws/wsse_security_header.c:
	   register all namespace that contains a Security header object.

	XML: add an API to set namespace on a single instance of a LassoNode
	 * lasso/xml/xml.h lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   add a new public API lasso_node_set_custom_namespace(node, prefix,
	   href). It allows to set the precise namespace of a single object, all
	   other instance of the same class continue to use the default
	   namespace for the class.
	   It should be used for difficult consumer of certain nodes (like
	   wsse:Security) which only know certain namespace or do not use the
	   namespace going with the specified version of a specification (like
	   MSP not following ID-WSF 1.0 specification and using
	   http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd
	   instead of
	   http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2003/06/secext.
	   It also allows to share implementation of schema objects common to
	   many version of the same specification (wsse:Security between ID-WSF
	   1.0 and ID-WSF 2.0), without creating too many child classes.

	ID-WSF 2.0: remove obsolete FIXME in discovery.h

	Core: remove a use of lasso_node_destroy in LassoSession

	Bindings: add support for guchar
	 * bindings/java/lang.py:
	 * bindings/python/lang.py:
	   add guchar to list of C types everywhere.

	XML: add support for free xml content to LassoMiscTextNode
	 * lasso/xml/misc_text_node.c:
	 * lasso/xml/misc_text_node.h:
	   it is often necessary to be able to put completely determined content
	   inside lasso generated request (for example when copying an assertion
	   for a Bearer authentication method). In this case you can use
	   lasso_node_get_original_xml_node to get at the original content and
	   lasso_misc_text_node_new_with_xml_node to get a LassNode with the
	   same content.
	   There are two additional function to acces this xml payload:
	   lasso_misc_text_node_get_xml_content and
	   lasso_misc_text_node_set_xml_content.

2009-08-28  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core: fix commit 4313, restore support for --enable-wsf
	 * configure.ac:
	   I throwed the baby with the bathwater..

	Core: fix make dist with --enable-wsf
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/Makefile.am:
	 * lasso/xml/Makefile.am:
	   some files were missing from the dist files, add them.

	Core: remove SWIG ID-WSF warning from configure.ac
	 * configure.ac:
	   as ID-WSF support in SWIG in not maintained anymore we can remove the
	   warning about using pre-generated SWIG files with a different setting
	   for the --enable-wsf flag.

	Binding: skip lasso_data_service_get_query_item
	 * bindings/overrides.xml:
	   bindings do not support out arguments, so skip generating bindings
	   for lasso_data_service_get_query_item for the moment.

	Core: set tar-pax as dist file format
	 * configure.ac:
	   we could have more than 99 characters long path in the dist files,
	   the pax format for tar archives support it.

	ID-WSF 1.0: Fixed missing or deprecated functions in public headers
	Some new functions were missing from the headers, others were deprecated
	some time ago and as the API is not considered stable for ID-WSF, I
	removed them definitely.

2009-08-27  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Bindings: Skip lasso_data_service_get_answers
	 * bindings/overrides.xml: skip unsupported function.

	Tests: add configuration file loading to integration test
	 * tests/integration/README:
	 * tests/integration/saml2/__init__.py:
	   If ~/.config/lasso_integration.conf exists, load it to find path to
	   authentic and lcs.
	   Add support for three environement variables:
	    - LASSO_BUILDDIR, to specify an out of source build directory to
	      test,
	    - NO_SILENT, to allow authentic and lcs outputs,
	    - VALGRIND, to check memory leaks using valgrind.

	Call gtkdocize before automake

2009-08-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core: errors.c is a generated file, when generating it place it in $(srcdir) not build directory
	 * lasso/Makefile.am:
	   the place for errors.c is in the source directory, not the build
	   directory.

	SAML 2.0: Fix bug introduced in commit 4235
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/login.c:

	Core: Fix errors.c generation

	XML SAML2: remove typedef of LassoSaml2Assertion in saml2_advice.h and saml2_evidence.h
	 * xml/saml-2.0/saml2_advice.h xml/saml-2.0/saml2_evidence.h:
	   the declaration of LassoSaml2Assertion for supposedly preventing

	   include of lasso.h is useless, replace by including directly export.h
	 * lasso/registry.c:
	   directly include errors.h

	ID-WSF: remove OFTYPE usage from header

2009-08-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Docs: change the doc production and lot of other fixes
	 * lasso/Makefile.am:
	   distribute extract_sections.py
	 * docs/references/lasso/lasso.types.in: add missing class (mainly SAML2
	   and ID-WSF 1.0/2.0) from docs/references/lasso.types.in

	 * lasso/xml/strings.h:
	   add lots of documentation, or at least documentation template to
	   strings constants.
	 * id-ff/login.h:
	 * saml-2.0/assertion_query.h:
	 * xml/xml.h:
	   document undocumented enumerations.
	 * lasso/errors.h:
	   add proper documentation about error codes.
	 * lasso/errors.c:
	   new version of the lasso_strerror function
	 * lasso/build_strerror.py:
	   update the script that generater lasso_strerror from the
	   documentation comments.

	   Remove usage of OFTYPE

	 * lasso/id-ff/session.c:
	 * lasso/id-ff/session.h:
	   remove usage of oftype, prefer gtk-introspection annotations instead.
	 * lasso/id-wsf/data_service.h:
	 * lasso/id-wsf/data_service.c:
	   do the same.

	   Add a script to build lasso-sections.txt

	 * lasso/extract_sections.py:
	   this script parses header files and generated lasso-sections.txt
	   content for GObject class descriptions.

	   Add a template file for the lasso-section.txt file

	 * docs/references/lasso-sections.txt.in:
	   this file serves as a base for the generation of lasso-sections.txt

	   Update docs/references/Makefile.am for generating lasso-sections.txt

	 * docs/references/Makefile.am:
	   always rebuild template, using out of source build directory is too
	   weird without it.
	   call new script extract_sections.py to regenerate lasso-sections.txt
	   if header files changed.

	   Update lasso.sgml file with all missing sections

	 * docs/reference/lasso.sgml:
	   add all missing sections, mainly objects from XML schemas.

	 * docs/reference/lasso-sections.txt: update it

	 * *.c: add section documentation to some files.
	 * lasso/xml/strings.h: fix bad usage or docbook markup

2009-08-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core: fix makefile for generating errors.h in out of source dir build
	 * lasso/Makefile.am:
	   errors.h is expected to be in srcdir not builddir.

	Bindings: for functions that must be totally skiped do it during parsing
	 * bindings/bindings.py:
	   parsing of argument type is still not advanced enough, so in order to
	   remove spurious warnings, skip function directly during parsing just
	   before the treatment of function signature.

	Tests: in integration test do not set the PYTHONPATH
	 * tests/integration/saml2/__init__.py:
	   to permit using build directory different from the src directory, do
	   not force the PYTHONPATH to be relative to src dir to find lasso
	   python module.

	Tests: do not hardcode PYTHONPATH in the valgrind wrapper
	 * tests/integration/valgrind-wrapper.sh: remove PYTHONPATH setting.

	Tests: distribute integration tests
	 * tests/Makefile.am:
	   add integration directory to the distdir.

	Core: Use automake-1.11 when possible
	 * Makefile.am:
	   use new automake-1.11 silent rules if possible
	   move macros to m4 directory
	 * m4/gtk-doc.m4:
	   add gtk-doc macros.
	 * lasso/Makefile.am:
	   add missing -f flag to rm, to unbreak make distcheck
	 * docs/references/Makefile.am:
	   fix problem between libtool and gtk-doc
	 * autogen.sh:
	   update to autogen.sh from gtk-doc, add support for automake-1.11

	Tests: Add data files to EXTRA_DIST
	 * tests/data/Makefile.am:
	   data file for tests2 were missing (to pass distcheck).

2009-08-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	XML: remove all useless instance_init functions
	 * Use Coccinelle semantic patch tool (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/) to
	   remove useless instance_init functions, the first patch applied was:
	@@
	type T,V;
	identifier I, J;
	parameter list P;
	expression E1;
	@@

	V instance_init(T node)
	{
	<...
	(
	-  E1 = 0;
	|
	-  E1 = NULL;
	|
	-  E1 = FALSE;
	)
	...>
	}
	   It removes useless initialization to 0 (GObject already zeroes
	   allocated objects).
	   The second one is:
	@ rule1 @
	type T;
	identifier node,fn;
	@@

	- static void fn(T *node) { }

	@ rule2 extends rule1 @
	typedef GType, GInstanceInitFunc;
	identifier type_constructor;
	@@
	GType type_constructor()
	{
	<...
	- (GInstanceInitFunc)fn
	+ NULL
	...>
	}
	   It removes empty instance_init functions.

2009-08-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	sb2:TargetIdentity can have a content
	 * lasso/xml/id-wsf-2.0/sb2_target_identity.c:
	 * lasso/xml/id-wsf-2.0/sb2_target_identity.h:
	   add support for any content.

	All: Rework include files handling, separated ID-WSF code from SAML2/ID-FF code
	 * nearly all C files: change includes for relative paths.
	 * lasso/id-wsf/id_wsf.h, lasso/id-wsf-2.0/id_wsf_2.h: add top level
	   public include files for ID-WSF 1.0 and ID-WSF 2.0.
	 * lasso/id-ff/server.*, lasso/id-ff/session.*, lasso/id-ff/identity.*:
	   remove most of the code related to ID-WSF and push into
	   lasso/id-wsf/id_ff_extensions.* and lasso/id-wsf-2.0/identity.c,
	   lasso/id-wsf-2.0/server.c, lasso/id-wsf-2.0/session.c.
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/saml2_login.c,
	   lasso/id-wsf-2.0/saml2_login_private.h: same change but for ID-WSF
	   2.0 support in SAML2 SSO profile.

	Bindings: skip ID-WSF methods with unsupported signatures
	 * bindings/overrides.xml:
	   some functions have output parameters (pointer on pointers) that are
	   currently not supported by our binding generator, so we skip them.

	SWIG: unplug id-wsf support in SWIG
	 * swig/Lasso.i:
	   force LASSO_WSF_ENABLED to be undefined.

	Tests: allow tests2 to pass distcheck
	 * tests/Makefile.am
	   add an SRCDIR symbol.
	   remove unused include paths.
	 * tests/tests2.c:
	   use SRCDIR to find data files.

	Tests: remove internal content from data files
	 * tests/data/response-3:
	   this dump of a SAML message contains elements and attribute outside
	   the SAML schema, implementation detail from Lasso. They broke
	   execution of tests/tests2.

	XML&SAML 2.0: add missing include files
	 * lasso/xml/saml-2.0/saml2_encrypted_element.h:
	   xmlSecKey is present in a function signature, so include
	   xmlsec/xmlsec.h.

	SWIG: implement change to LassoSession in the SWIG interface file
	 * swig/Lasso.i:
	   remove LassoSession::is_dirty attribute and rewrite the
	   getProviderIds function.

	XML: only recurse into xml/id-wsf subdirs if --enable-wsf is true
	 * lasso/xml/Makefile.am:
	   put id-wsf and id-wsf2 subdirs under a conditionnal.

	ID-WSF 1.0: remove absent header file from the Makefile.am
	 * lasso/id-wsf/Makefile.am:
	   remove data_service_private.h from header file list.

	Core: SOAP is also used by SAML bindings
	 * extract_symbols.py, extract_types.py:
	   export SOAP types whatever the value of the flag --enable-wsf.
	   It still worked because constructor for GObject calls get_type, but
	   there is a race condition: if you receive a SOAP message before
	   sending one, it fails. Only soap_binding types must be removed.

2009-08-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	ID-FF&Core: Seal public field of LassoSession
	 * id-ff/session.h: seal public fields.

	 * id-ff/session.c, id-ff/sessionprivate.h: add accessors for reading
	   the is_dirty flag and counting store assertions.

	 * id-ff/logout.c, id-ff/login.c, saml-2.0/login.c, saml-2.0/logout.c,
	   saml-2.0/profile.c: use the new accessors.

	 * id-ff/profile.c: include the private header file, use the new
	   accessors, and remove unnecessary setting of is_dirty to FALSE (it
	   should be false at instanciation).

	 * utils.h: add a macro to access private content, prepare for using
	   G_TYPE_INSTANCE_GET_PRIVATE and the GObject infrastructure for
	   private structures eventually.

2009-08-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	ID-WSF 2.0: remove unused variable
	 - lasso/id-wsf-2.0/discovery.c: remove unused variable in discovery.c

	Core: fix bad name of lasso_unlink_and_release_node
	 * lasso/utils.h:
	   - rename lasso_unlink_and_release_node to
	     lasso_release_list_of_xml_node.
	   - add a GList iteration macro: lasso_foreach.

2009-08-26  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	      by the next call by lasso_wsf_profile_build_soap_response_msg, to
	      use in sub classes,
	    - lasso_wsf_profile_set/get_status_code, set/get the stored status
	      code, to use in the next lasso_xxx_build_response_message, to use
	      in sub classes.
	   Change name lasso_wsf_profile_get_description_autos to

	    pointed to by xpathErrorCode if it is not NULL.

	Tests: Add a fourth data loading test
	 * tests/data/response-4: test content
	 * tests/tests2.c: add loading of the new file.

	   if not initialized, do not free. do not segfault on NULL argument.

	Do not respect default semantic of dst:Query
	 * lasso/id-wsf-2.0/data_service.c:
	   the specification for data service template indicat that the query
	   must fail at the first failing query, we think this is a stupid
	   behaviour so I set the default to keep running query until the last
	   one and returning a partial result if at least one failed and a

	   lasso_saml20_logout_process_response_msg.

	SAML 2.0 Login: use generic methods
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/login.c:
	   use new generic profile methods for saml 2.0 in
	   lasso_saml20_login_process_paos_response_msg,
	   lasso_saml20_login_process_authn_response_msg,
	   lasso_saml20_login_process_response_status_and_assertion.

	 * lasso/saml-2.0/assertion_query.c:
	   use new code in SAML 2.0 profile.c to parse requests and decrypt
	   nameid, chains calls so that error are kept but all actions are
	   accomplished anyway (if first call fails, keep the error but continue
	   the processing, then at end return the first returned error).

2009-03-27  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	SAML 2.0: add internal generic implementation
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/profile.c:
	 * lasso/saml-2.0/profileprivate.h:
	   the current effort is to simplify implementation code in saml-2.0 and
	   much of the other frameworks. Those new methods:
	        lasso_saml20_init_request

	        lasso_saml20_profile_setup_request_signing
	        lasso_saml20_profile_build_request_msg
	        lasso_saml20_profile_build_response
	        lasso_saml20_profile_init_response
	   should help reduce code in login.c, logout.c, name_id_management.c
	   and assertion_query.c. They should also permit to make all profiles
	   at the same level of binding support
	   (GET,REDIRECT,POST,ARTIFACT_GET,ARTIFACT_POST).

	   Those function centralize error code handling, initialization of
	   commong class (LassoSamlp2StatusResponse and
	   LassoSamlp2RequestAbstract) and also the handling of NameID
	   decryption.

2009-03-27  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Core: add new internal macro lasso_extract_node_or_fail
	 * lasso/utils.h:
	   this new macro try to extract a field from a structre (or any
	   left-hand-side value), try to typecheck it using 'LASSO_IS_XXX',
	   if succesfull, the value is assigned to the variable given as first
	   argument or we jump to the 'cleanup' goto label, setting the 4th
	   argument as the current error code (value of variable 'rc').

	   inside the LassoProvider class. this new methods comes with complete
	   documentation.
	 * lasso/xml/tools.c:
	   add a xmlDoc argument to lasso_verify_signature, in order to
	   reuse an already built message context, and possible problems with

	   validate a signature.
	 * lasso/xml/tools.c:
	   lasso_xml_parse_message is able to parse a message of any type, or of
	   a given type. If a message of another than the one specified is
	   found, the call fails, and a LASSO_MESSAGE_FORMAT_ERROR is returned.

	Core: add function to extract SOAP message content
	 * lasso/xml/tools.c:
	   add lasso_xml_is_soap, to verify that a message is SOAP.
	   add lasso_xml_get_soap_content, to retrieve the first child of the

	 * lasso/xml/saml-2.0/saml2_attribute_value.c:
	 * lasso/xml/saml_attribute_value.c:
	   implement get_xmlNode for the AttributeValue and Extensions objects.
	   If the any field is empty, use the original_xmlnode value.  In order
	   to support free-style content, you must use the method
	   lasso_node_set_original_xmlnode, properties and children are
	   extracted from the given node and added to the node created by the
	   generic get_xmlNode virtual method.

	   Makefile no need to verify change in the content of the file, just
	   overwrite it.

	Core: Fix argument checking in init_from_xml
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   In lasso_node_impl_init_from_xml if xmlnode is null, return an error
	   but if no node_data specification is present, do not fail but print a
	   warning. It is not an error for a class to not have a node_data
	   private field.
	   add a comment to fix return code later.

	* lasso/id-ff/session.h: add the OFTYPE decorator to the return type of
	  lasso_session_get_assertions.

	Java: add assertions
	* bindings/java/tests/LoginTest.java: add assertion for the return code
	  of lasso_logout_process_request_msg.

	ID-FF 1.2: review of logout validate request
	 * lasso/id-ff/logout.c (lasso_logout_validate_request): use new macros.

	ID-FF 1.2: review logout_process_request_msg
	 * lasso/id-ff/logout.c (lasso_logout_process_request_msg): use the
	   new allocation macros, add checking of the parsed object type, add
	   validation of some schema constraints before processing, like
	   presence of the name identifier.

	Core: make caller owner of the list, fix refcount leak

	Autoconf: new macro AS_COMPILER_FLAGS to check flag support
	 * macros/as-compiler-flags.m4 configure.ac: add a new files of autoconf macro
	   to check support of warning flags, add needed line in configure.ac to define
	   variable WARNING_FLAGS, containing only supported flags.

	Core: replace manual reference handling with macros
	 - lasso/xml/disco_insert_entry.c (lasso_disco_insert_entry_new) :
	   replace manual g_object_ref with assignment macro.

	Core: replace manual handling of references with macros
	 - lasso/xml/disco_resource_offering.c (lasso_disco_resource_offering_new)
	    replace manual g_object_ref with assignment macro.

	 - use new memory macros
	 - copying nodes instead of stealing nodes

	ID-FF 1.2: fix leak of instance object

	Core: add a new messsage format error for XSchema constraint failure

	ID-FF 1.2: review logout_validate_request
	 * lasso/id-ff/logout.c (lasso_logout_validate_request):
	  - when signature verification failed in process_request_msg,
	    do not continue validation of the request, stop immediately and
	    return the signature status code.
	  - use utils.h macro for memory allocation handling. Fix potential leak
	    of the profile->response object.

	ID-FF 1.2: validate signatures on responses during the BRWS/Artifact profile
	- lasso/id-ff/login.c:
	  - the lasso_login_process_response_msg is used to process SOAP response
	    to artifact resolution requests. The answer contains an samlp:Response
	    that can be signed, and each contained assertion MUST be individually
	    signed.
	- lasso/xml/samlp_response.c:
	 - set keep_xmlnode flag on the class metadatas to help in signature
	   validations.

	ID-FF 1.2: add validation of assertion signatures
	 - lasso/id-ff/login.c:
	  - lasso_login_process_response_status_and_assertion:
	   - if signature_status is not 0 and an assertion is present, we
	     validate the signature on this assertion using the
	     internal API lasso_provider_verify_saml_signature.

	Core: add error code LOGIN_ERROR_REFER_TO_UNKNOWN_REQUEST
	* lasso/errors.h, lasso/errors.c:
	  - LASSO_LOGIN_ERROR_REFER_TO_UNKNOWN_REQUEST is raised when a
	    samlp:Response contains an attribute inResponseTo when when no
	    previous request can be found inside the LassoLogin object or if the
	    given ID is not the as the one fome the previous request.

	ID-FF 1.2: fix signature validation in login_process_authn_response_msg
	* lasso/id-ff/login.c:
	  when signature validation fails on a message, then return the
	  signature status as return code. There is a security fix.

	XML: new LassoProvider API to verify XMLDsig signatures
	* lasso/id-ff/provider.c, lasso/id-ff/providerprivate.h:
	  - (lasso_provider_verify_saml_signature) validate a signed
	    saml Request, Response or Assertion, using the public key
	    of the given provider.

	XML: Make LassoSamlAssertion keep its XML form when created by parsing
	* lasso/xml/saml_assertion.c: set the keep_original flag of class
	  LassoSamlAssertion to true, to keep a copy of the original libxml tree
	  used to initialize eache instance of this object.  We will use it to
	  validate signature on assertions.

	XML: Add internal API to validate XMLDsig signatures
	* lasso/xml/tools.c:
	  - lasso_saml_constrain_dsigctxt() add constraints following SAML
	    specifications on XMLDsig signatures to an libxmlsec DSig context.
	  - lasso_verify_signature() this function given an xmlNode and a key or
	    a keys manager (for a set of AC or AC chains) validate the
	    envelopped signature set upon this node. It can be instructed to
	    follow constraints of the SAML 1.0 specification.

	Core: add new error codes
	* lasso/errors.h: add error codes for,
	  - out of memory situation,
	  - excess of references during validation of signature on SAML
	    protocols message or assertions,
	  - an invalid reference during validation of signatures on SAML
	    protocols message or assertions,
	  - an mismatch between requested assertion issuer and received
	    assertion issuer.

	Autoconf: redirect shell warning in one of configure.ac tests
	 - configure.ac: when testing if bindings have been already generated
	   with differents settings do not let grep emit warnings.

	All: Fix missing field initializer problems
	* lots of files: Explicitely set all field of initialized structures,
	  in order to remove -Wno-missing-field-initilizers from needed
	  compiler options when using -Wall -Wextra.

	Core: add macros to assign list of things, rename xmlNode related macros
	* lasso/utils.h: added new macros, renamed others:
	  - macros handling xmlNode are renamed from _node to _xml_node,
	  - new macros for assign GList* of specific objects:
	    - lasso_assign_list_of_gobjects,
	    - lasso_assign_list_of_strings,
	    - lasso_assign_new_list_of_gobjects,
	  - macros for assigning xmlChar string (we need a specific macros
	    because, we must use xmlFree to release the destination string),
	  - macros to add string without duping: lasso_list_add_xml_string,
	  - macros to add anything non-null (no type cast):
	    lasso_list_add_non_null.

	Core: add references handling macros
	* lasso/utils.h:
	  - add macro lasso_transfer_string and lasso_transfer_gobject,
	    to transfer ownership of such objects without copying or
	    their changing reference count. The old containing variable is
	    NULLed.
	  - lasso_list_add_gobject,lasso_list_add_new_gobject: test if the added
	    object is a GObject, if not do not add it and print a warning.
	  - lasso_check_type_equality: this macro use special builtin functions
	    only with GCC (typeof and __builtin_types_compatible_p) and do
	    metaprogramming using anonymous enumeration type to make compile
	    time assertions. It is used
	 -  add macros to release XPathObject XPathContext, macro constructor to
	    make reference transfert macros (free dest, nullify dest, copy src
	    to dest without increasing refcount, nullify src), add a macro to
	    transfert xpath objects.

	Core: new goto_exit macro which produces warnings
	* lasso/utils.h:
	  similar macro to goto_exit_if_fail but also produce a printed warning.

	Core: new macros for adding string to GList
	* lasso/utils.h:
	  - lasso_list_add_string, add a copy of a string to a GList

	Core: Remove unused macro lasso_warn_deprecated
	* lasso/utils.h: remove macros lasso_warn_deprecated, use GCC
	  attributes and gtkdoc markers instead.

	   characters.

	Fix uninitialized return code
	Thanks Emmanuel Dreyfus

2008-11-04  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Fix overwriting of attributes ht by node lists
	 - lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   - In lasso_node_impl_init_from_xml fix really old bug seen when
	     running ID-WSF 2 python tests, when looking for snippet_any
	     field in the GObject we should not take the any attribute field,
	     otherwise the field value is gonna be overwritten with new GList
	     nodes. The problem ca be seen only with classes using the two kind
	     of snippets (ANY nodes and ANY attributs).

	Change style of error and dellocation handling
	 - lasso/id-ff/provider.c:
	   - in lasso_provider_verify_signature use standardised memory and
	     error handling macros, and also standard return code variable name
	     and exit label.
	   - in lasso_providerl_load_metadata_from_buffer and
	     lasso_provider_load_metadata use the standardised macros, exit
	     labels and return code variable.
	 - lasso/id-ff/server.c:
	   - in lasso_server_load_affiliation use standardised allocation and
	     error handling macros.
	 - lasso/id-wsf/wsf_profile.c:
	   - use standardised memory and error handling macros in
	     lasso_wsf_profile_build_soap_request_msg.

	Move xmlDoc release after xmlFreeXPath*
	 - lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   - in lasso_node_new_from_soap release xmlDoc (and the contained
	     nodes) after the XPath objects that can reference them.

	Remove use of xmlFreeDoc for lasso_release_doc
	  - bindings/java/wrapper_top.c, bindings/php4/lasso_php4_helper.c,
	    bindings/php5/wrapper_source_top.c, bindings/python/wrapper_top.c,
	    lasso/id-ff/identity.c, lasso/id-ff/lecp.c, lasso/id-ff/login.c,
	    lasso/id-ff/logout.c, lasso/id-ff/name_registration.c,
	    lasso/id-ff/profile.c, lasso/id-ff/provider.c, lasso/id-ff/server.c,
	    lasso/id-ff/session.c, lasso/id-wsf-2.0/data_service.c,
	    lasso/id-wsf/data_service.c, lasso/id-wsf/discovery.c,
	    lasso/id-wsf/wsf_profile.c, lasso/saml-2.0/ecp.c,
	    lasso/saml-2.0/login.c, lasso/saml-2.0/name_id_management.c,
	    lasso/utils.h, lasso/xml/tools.c, lasso/xml/xml.c, swig/Lasso.i:
	    Remove use of xmlFreeDoc. Use lasso_release_doc instead.

	Clean generated files in bindings
	  * bindings/java/Makefile.am:
	  * bindings/php5/Makefile.am:
	  * bindings/python/Makefile.am:
	   - reformat value and add generated files to the MOSTLYCLEANFILES
	     variable

	Add new utils macros
	 - lasso/utils.h:
	   - add goto_exit_with_rc a standardized macro that suppose having an
	     'int rc' variable and an exit label in the current function.
	   - add lasso_release_output_buffer macro

	Fix lasso_assign_node: wrong xmlFreeNodeList
	  * lasso/utils.h:
	   - (lasso_assign_node) This macro wrongly assumes that the destroy
	     function for xmlNode is xmlFreeNodeList but it's xmlFreeNode.
	     xmlFreeNodeList is for xmlNode list of children.

2008-11-03  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Restore ABI compatibility wrt original_xmlNode
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	  - use set/get_qdata to store the original xmlnode, modify
	    init_from_xml and dispose function to cope with this new storage
	    place.
	 * lasso/xml/xml.h:
	  - remove field original_xmlNode from structure LassoNode to keep ABI
	    compatibility with previous versions.
	  - declare new API lasso_node_get_original_xmlnode

	API to cleanup LassoNode tree of keeped xmlNode
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	  - add a new function lasso_node_cleanup_original_xmlnodes to
	    disallocate all keeped xmlNode inside a tree of LassoNodes.
	  - add internal function lasso_node_traversal to iterate across a
	    LassoNode tree (could be used to reimplement lasso_node_destroy)
	    It is a preorder traversal.

	Add support for keep_xmlnode flag
	 * lasso/xml/xml.c:
	   - (lasso_node_impl_init_from_xml) When the keep_xmlnode flag is true
	     for the currently parsed Node class, we copy the parsed xmlNode
	     and keep inside the LassoNode.
	   - (lasso_node_dispose) if an original_xmlNode is present, we disallocate
	     it.

	Add original_xmlNode pointer to LassoNode
	 * lasso/xml/xml.h: add an xmlNode field to base class LassoNode,
	   to permit retrieving the xmlNode originally parsed when the structure
	   is the result of parsing. Will be used by signature checking code.

	Add keep_xmlnode field to LassoNodeClassData
	 * lasso/xml/private.h: add a boolean flag named keep_xmlnode to
	   base class structure LassoNodeClassData.

2008-11-02  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Add test case for loading server completely from memory
	* tests/login_test.c:
	  - add generateIdentityProviderContextDumpMemory that first load
	    metadata, private_key and certificate file using g_file_get_contents
	    then use the created buffers to initialize a LassoServer object.
	  - add test03_serviceProviderLogin that use the new function.

	LassoServer init_from_xml/new_from_buffer handling
	* lasso/id-ff/server.c: (init_from_xml) if load_metadata fail
	  try load_metadata_from_buffer instead using the content of the dumped
	  nodes.

	Add new constructor lasso_server_new_from_buffers
	 * lasso/id-ff/server.c, lasso/id-ff/server.h: add new function to build
	   a LassoServer object holding content of certificate and private key
	   files intead of loading them everytime signing is needed. You must
	   instead load them yourself the first time.

	Export lasso_provider_load_metadata_from_buffer
	* lasso/id-ff/providerprivate.h: add declaration for private function
	  lasso_provider_load_metadata_from_buffer

	Add verification of access before calling libxml loading function
	* lasso/id-ff/provider.c: (lasso_provider_load_metadata) libxml emit warning
	  when trying to parse non-existing or non-accessible file, so verify
	  that the file is accessible before calling libxml. (the corner
	  case of having warning when the file become inaccessible between
	  the two calls is non-interesting)

	First try accessing the file before calling key loading functions
	* lasso/xml/tools.c: (lasso_sign_node) instead of waiting
	  for the xmlsec key loading function to fail before trying to load
	  the key directly from the private_key buffer, test it using
	  POSIX function.

	Add possibility to sign using preloaded keys
	* lasso/xml/tools.c:
	 - (lasso_sign_node) if loading of the private_key or the certificate
	   file we try to use the filename directly as a key in the PEM format.

2008-10-22  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Add missing initializations.

2008-10-16  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

2008-10-13  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Integrate modification from Olav Morken <olavmo@stud.ntnu.no>
	It fixes bad url encoding of relaystates for logout
	profile. A better fix for all profiles is coming.

	add files to nodist_HEADERS to pass distcheck

2008-10-01  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	add functionality to enable debugging flags at runtime
	This code permit to set flags, separated by commas, space,
	tabulations, or colons. This flags activates debug functions like,
	suppressing validations of signatures or print debugging message about
	deallocations.

	The new flags are defined in /lasso/debug.h they can be set using an
	environment variable named LASSO_FLAG or a function named
	lasso_set_flag.

	There are two flags currently:
	- verify-signature:
	  To deactivate it, pass 'no-verify-signature' inside LASSO_DEBUG.
	  It desactivate signature verification, inside two functions:
	  lasso_query_verify_signature and lasso_provider_verify_signature.
	- memory-debug:
	  It enabled reporting of memory deallocation inside generic memory
	  dellaocator for LassoNode objects and also in bindings.

	- lasso/xml/xml.c: do not free a null hash table pointer.

2008-10-01  Damien Laniel  <dlaniel@entrouvert.com>

	cleaned up some code

	fixed docstrings ; added an exported function ; reorganised functions in file

	fixed segfaults

	fixed xml indentation

2008-09-23  Damien Laniel  <dlaniel@entrouvert.com>

	If ProviderID isn't found in an AuthnResponse, immediately return a critical error

2008-09-23  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Many fix to compile with --enable-wsf and --enable-debugging and also to remove valgrind errors through python tests.
	1. Rename lasso_wsf_profile_new_full for java bindings (cannot subclass
	   in overrides of static methods).
	2. Add const modifiers to many functon signatures in
	   bindings/python/wrapper_top.c.
	3. add initialisation of private_data->encryption_sym_key_type (to
	   please valgrind) in instance_init of LassoProvider.
	4. Add new macro to assign xmlNode, we consider xmlNode to be an
	   immutable value, and always use xmlCopyNode for assignment. The
	   macros is called named lasso_assign_node.
	5. Fix segfault, when using xmlSec to encrypt the newly created
	   encrypted node replace the original node inside the xmlDoc structure,
	   and the original node is freed automatically. So you cannot borrow
	   the encrypted if you do not remove it from xmlDoc first.

2008-09-17  Damien Laniel  <dlaniel@entrouvert.com>

	free xmlDoc only once

	fixed docstring

	php: added a root class to define generic getter and setter

	fixed docstrings which fucked php5 binding

2008-09-16  Damien Laniel  <dlaniel@entrouvert.com>

	fixed various bugs with new compilation flags

	enable optimisation flag when not debugging

2008-09-12  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	* Remove ending blanks

	* Reset CFLAGS when --enable-debugging is used (remove -g -O2 value setted by AC_PROG_CC). * Show AM_CFLAGS + CFLAGS in resume when configure finish.

	* When --enable-debugging is used, add -Wno-xxx options to AM_CFLAGS so that   bindings compile with -Werror (-Werror is activated by --enable-debugging now)

	* Add G_GNUC_UNUSED for unused parameter we can't remove (python wrappers).

	* Add options when DEBUGGING is activated, i.e. to permit compiling when -Werror is used. It removes   some of the warning for code we do not control.

	* Select bindings in bindings/Makefile not in bindings/*/Makefile.

	* Remove warnings:  - remove unused parameter from private function signatures  - remove unused variable  - initialize variable potentially accessed uninitialized  - add G_GNUC_UNUSED if function is public or adhering to an interface, and a    parameter is unused.  - if ID-WSF is not compiled in, define stubs with G_GNUC_UNUSED on parameters.  The goal is to compile with -Werror.

	* Add setting of AM_CFLAGS when --enable-debugging is used * Export the AM_CFLAGS variable * Create a conditionnal for automake named DEBUGGING * Show CFLAGS in resume of configuration option

	* Add support of lasso_registry to lasso_node_new_from_xmlNode. * Add full support for xsi:type, with lookup of the QName namespace, will only   work if lib: namespace is correctly declared in the dumped XML fragment. * Add a test for the new functionnality in lasso_node_new_from_xmlNode.

2008-09-04  Benjamin Dauvergne  <bdauvergne@entrouvert.com>

	Add a new error code, with the REGISTRY prefix and use it in registry function returning an error code. Fix a typo when retrieving a quark string in the registry modulke. Improve tests for functional mapping.

	Fix regression when loading a LassoServer from dump. Fix an error with -rpath setting in last commit, -rpath must always be absolute paths.

2008-09-03  Damien Laniel  <dlaniel@entrouvert.com>

	don't put registry functions in the bindings

	Fix changed name of g_assign_string in wsf_profile.c

	Add public function lasso_server_add_provider_from_buffer, to add a provider from an XML string of the metadatas (changed semantic of the second argument compared to lasso_server_add_provider). To support this a new public LassoProvider constructor was added: lasso_provider_new_from_buffer, where the second argument is an XML string. It uses a new private function, lasso_provider_load_metadata_from_buffer.

	Add documentation to lasso_server_add_service_from_dump.

	Complete documentation of lasso_server_add_service.

	add a new headers <lasso/utils.h> with macros to handle memory like assigning a gobject field (work flow, is you augment ref of the new value, decrease the one from the old, and then assign), assigning strings, releasing lists of strings, of gobjects,etc.. the free macros are all called g_release_somehting and they set the released variable to NULL. add a macro to validate GObject parameter types
	This header is intended to concentre every bit of wisdom for handling pointers
	and memory, try to use thoses macros in your code.
	They are not intended to work with weak references (references you do not own),
	so always g_object_ref in this case (or use g_assign_gobject that does it,
	when your variable is not needed anymore to g_assign_gobject(var, NULL));

	return LassoPersonalProfileService from disco->getService if appropriate

	cleaned up PersonalProfileService

	cleaning and documenting profile service

	fixed lasso_profile_service_add_query_item so it accepts a item_id parameter (since they are mandatory once there is more than one).  also allows init_query to specify item_id.  this gives:
	service = disco.getService()
	service.initQuery('/pp:PP/pp:CommonName'), 'name')
	service.addQueryItem('/pp:PP/pp:MsgContact'), 'email')
	soap_answer = liberty.root.soap_call(service.msgUrl, service.msgBody)

	  identity = get_identity_by_resource_id(service.request.resourceId)
	  service.resourceData = identity.get_pp_view()
	  service.buildResponseMsg()
	  return service.msgBody

	client:
	  service.processQueryResponseMsg(soap_answer)
	  service.getAnswer()
	  # or service.getAnswer('/pp:PP/pp:CommonName')

2005-08-12  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	idwsf/pp on the attribute provider side; sth like
	service = lasso.ProfileService(server)
	service.processQueryMsg(soap_message)
	identity = get_from(service.request.resourceId)
	service.resourceData = identity.convert_to_pp_xml()

	first steps towards id-wsf/dst; something like this, in Python:
	service = disco.getService()
	service.initQuery('/pp:PP/pp:CommonName')
	service.buildRequestMsg()
	 -> service.msgUrl and .msgBody

	added LASSO_ERROR_UNIMPLEMENTED error code

	disco.processQueryMsg now sets disco.resourceId

	new remove entry; correctly restore resource offerings from identity dump

	renamed crunch to build since it doesn't look like there is a need for an intermediate function for the moment.  process remove entries.  create correct answer (when everything goes ok, no support for failure yet)

	no longer allows NULL to get the first known remote provider id

	define check variables

	don't use am_path_check since it fails when check is not available (while it should continue and disable the test suite)

	added support for SNIPPET_OPTIONAL (for use with SNIPPET_INTEGER or SNIPPET_BOOLEAN) (not that really tested)

	updated list of java swig generated files

2005-01-12  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

2005-01-12  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

	Corrected SWIG PHP output patch to be pre-C99 compatible.

	Swig: Cancel a %newobject getitem, because a %newobject getitem applies to every method getitem in every classes below. This caused an "interesting" memory handling bug.

	Beginning to add binding specific tests. The objective is to port these tests to every binding. Discovered a binding bug in list handling.

2005-01-11  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	homogenous quoting for "x" comparisons

	even more files to ignore

	include new java files (note that I also modified the buildbox, it was not checking lasso.jar file, it does now and will therefore fail, too bad)

2005-01-10  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	documented lasso_node_get_xmlNode

2005-01-09  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	fixed comment about gcc 2.95

	removed hack to get to lib; it doesn't seem to work elsewhere.

2005-01-09  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

	Swig: Added Assertion attribute in samlp:Response.

2005-01-08  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	moved remaining unbounded elements to GList* (samlp:Response/Assertion being part of that bunch)

2005-01-08  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

	In SWIG, enclosed %init code inside braces to preserve gcc 2.95 compatibility.

	completely handle memory management for sessions

	properly allocates memory for constant strings used in messages (or readonly memory would be freed and segfaults would happen)

	created serverprivate.h for two private #LassoServer methods

	rewrote lasso_login_init_idp_initiated_authn_request using lasso_login_init_authn_request to avoid duplication.

	don't care about NameFormat and NameQualifier in comparaison

	makefile perl magic to get distcheck running (disabled installation)

2005-01-03  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

2005-01-01  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	accounts for changes in lasso_node_dump

	Removed second and third parameters of lasso_node_dump since @encoding is always UTF-8 and @format is always to indent XML in lasso dumps.

	removed lasso_federation_set_local_name_identifier and lasso_federation_set_remote_name_identifier; they were no longer necessary.

2005-01-01  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

	documenting lasso_{login|lecp}_init_authn_request

	include LassoLibAssertion details into swig bindings.

	don't use $< since it fails with BSD make.

	only set Status in session on failure

	Store status in session to be restored for samlp:Response usage.  This means the session *must* be saved in single sign-on service url and will be dirty.
	(so souk, libertyidentity.py line 1076 failIf(login.isSessionDirty) will fail)

2004-12-28  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

	Added StatusCode binding in Logout. Reorganized objects in swig Lasso.i file.

2004-12-28  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	revamped autogen.sh so it works on FreeBSD (with many thanks to gnome-autogen.sh)

2004-12-28  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	return LASSO_LOGIN_ERROR_REQUEST_DENIED if that's the response Status

	fixed dependency on xmlsec1-openssl

	generate xmlsec signatures in get_xmlNode; this should allow envelopes (in LECP) to work properly.

	lasso requires xmlsec >= 1.2.6

	Added cast to remove compile time warning.

2004-12-27  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	Fixed lasso_lecp_build_authn_request_envelope_msg, lasso_lecp_process_authn_request_envelope_msg and lasso_lecp_build_authn_request_msg to properly deal with signatures (and, generally, to work)

	support for <lib:Extension> elements in query (not yet reconstructed); enabled for <lib:AuthnRequest>

	Moved back Extension support from xmlNode* to GList*; "SP login using post/artifact (testing Extension); SP logout using SOAP." test now works.

2004-12-26  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

	Replaced calls of lasso_provider_get_metadata_one with lasso_provider_get_assertion_consumer_service_url in lecp.

	Added SWIG support for "Extension" elements in lib:AuthnRequest.

2004-12-24  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	added lib:Extension support to dst classes.

	Added missing declaration for lasso_name_identity_mapping_new_from_dump (and moved dump type to const char*).

	errata2 makes SPProvidedNameIdentifier optional; changed schema snippet accordingly

	errata2 adds a NotOnOrAfter attribute to LogoutRequests

	removed obsolete comment

	Do not store metadata in provider dumps; only store the filename.  Handle AssertionConsumerServiceID in <lib:AuthnRequest>; this allows to have more than one AssertionConsumerServiceURL in a single service provider.

	more <lib:AuthnRequest> documentation

2004-12-23  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	removing lasso_config.h from scanned header files

	a few words about lib:AuthnRequest

	documented #LassoSamlNameIdentifier

	removed all old setter methods and other removed functions from documentation.

	dot at the end

	removed cut'n pasted doc from oasis

	removed liberty-alliance entity;

	documented #LassoLogout; actually most docstrings were already there but are way too much going into Lasso internals.  Not fixed yet.

	remove angle brackets around elements in doc strings so they can now be considered as docbook (necessary to produce itemized lists in docstrings)

	removed copy/pasted OASIS documentation

	Removed docstring copy/pasted from OASIS documentation (looks like BSD so it should be allowed if they are cited but I prefer to have full copyright over Lasso code)

	documented #LassoSession.  Removed lasso_session_get_authentication_method and lasso_session_get_first_providerID methods that were obsolete and unused.

	Commited Nicolas SWIG binding for WSF since he is on vacation.

	create namespace in the air not to disturb xmlnode

	disco:Status doesn't exist; once again fall back to UtilityStatus

	pp:Status are not DstStatus but UtilityStatus; acknowledge.

	fixed QueryResponse get_xmlNode function.

2004-12-22  Nicolas Clapies  <nclapies@entrouvert.com>

	Added missing header.

	Updated get_xmlNode().

	Added missing headers.

	refined symbol regex

	removed declaration of inexistant function

	removed unused variable

	ignoring some more swig generated files

	Updated list of files generated by SWIG in C# and Java bindings; fixed PHP Makefile.am; use $(srcdir) to get correct directory in code generation python scrips.  make distcheck works after that.

	only exports symbols declared with LASSO_EXPORT (experimental)

2004-12-21  Nicolas Clapies  <nclapies@entrouvert.com>

	Fixed call to constructor of LassoDiscoQueryResponse and LassoDiscoModifyResponse.

2004-12-21  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	added random suites with random tests

2004-12-21  Nicolas Clapies  <nclapies@entrouvert.com>

	Added lasso_disco_query_response_new_from_message() constructor.

	fixed name space in dump message of LassoDiscoQueryResponse and LassoDiscoModifyResponse : every element children inerit the discovery name space.

2004-12-21  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	don't use xmlSecFind to look up signature

2004-12-21  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	Severe libxml2 and xmlsec riot.
	Always put <ds:Signature> as the last node since it looks like the right thing
	to do (and even if the schema seems to say otherwise).

	Try to clean xml messages and remove redundant xml namespace declarations.
	Behind libxml2 back and cleaning memory properly.

	We���re off the streets now / And back on the road / On the riot trail.

2004-12-21  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	define correct namespace on QueryResponse

2004-12-20  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	removed unnecessary xmlReconciliateNs

	correctly sets namespace on Query and QueryResponse Personal Profile nodes.

	Fixed method declarations : lasso_personal_profile_service_process_query_msg() and lasso_personal_profile_service_process_query_msg_response().

	Removed GList type in lasso_discovery_add_insert_entry() params. Instead use simple type pointer until list support is implemented in swig binding. Added missing method lasso_discovery_process_query_response_msg().

2004-12-20  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	don't include in a second-level status code samlp error status

	Refactored signature code so it is now shared between requests/responses and artifacts.

2004-12-19  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	Added differentiation between creating xmlnode for lasso use (the _dump functions) and creating xmlnode for the wire (export_to_soap...).  This was necessary to keep track of private_key_file to use on an Assertion while it was kept in a lasso session dump and restored later.
	This means the get_xmlNode functions have now a second parameter, gboolean
	lasso_dump, TRUE when dumping for lasso internal use.

	On the bright side assertions are now signed (that signature is not yet
	checked).

2004-12-19  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	removed minitests from tests Makefile.am

	little tests benchmarking AuthnRequest creation and AuthnResponse processing.

	add nodes in reverse class order to get them in schema order

	Moved signature template stuff into xml.c and use XmlSnippet for them; this should insure proper validation against Liberty XML schemas and should help adding missing signature support to <Assertion>

	cleaning up process files

	if available, use profile->msg_relayState to init request in init_request functions.

2004-12-18  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	Moved LassoProfile->nameIdentifier from char* to LassoSamlNameIdentifier*, gaining back access to the nameFormat added late before 0.5.
	There are no bindings for LassoSamlNameIdentifier; as a temporary and
	compatible measure; profile->nameIdentifier in bindings continues to
	return a char* (profile->nameIdentifier->content).

	At the same time the same change has been done for
	LassoNameRegistration->oldNameIdentifier.

2004-12-17  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	Isolated CFLAGS to be used when compiling Lasso in LASSO_CORE_CFLAGS; don't use those when compiling tests in order to catch errors in headers. (continuing)

	Isolated CFLAGS to be used when compiling Lasso in LASSO_CORE_CFLAGS; don't use those when compiling tests in order to catch errors in headers.  Also moved a few things in header files; need more thinking about that.

	define LASSO_INTERNALS in lasso/

	don't export functions defined in tools.h

	<samlp:Status> created by Lasso should now be compatible with SAML requirements [SAMLCore11].
	[SAMLCore11] Maler, Eve, Mishra, Prateek, Philpott, Rob, eds. (27 May 2003).
	"Assertions and Protocol for the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language
	(SAML) V1.1," OASIS Committee Specification, version 1.1, Organization for the
	Advancement of Structured Information Standards

	deal with missing Status in LogoutResponse

	Done with the new query snippets system (everything but the IDPEntries in <lib:AuthnRequest>).  It has nested <samlp:StatusCode> support but ID-FF layer must still be updated to produce them.

	new (draft) query snippet mechanism to generate query string; deployed in <lib:RegisterNameIdentifier/>

2004-12-16  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	merged new error codes in SWIG and used one of them in the Python tests

	(almost) done with errors in ID-FF; remaining "return -1" have been converted to LASSO_ERROR_UNDEFINED (there are forty-three of them).
	LASSO_ERROR_UNDEFINED was redefined from -999 to -1 so it is easier to add new
	sequences of errros.

	added minimal support (only XML, no mapping to URL yet) for   <xs:element ref="Extension" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
	added memory management to list* XmlSnippet

2004-12-15  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	pointers are %p in format strings, not %x

	memory management work

	moved federation to XmlSnippet

	no longer play fool mixing pointers and integers; they are not always the same size and this bites quite hard on AMD-64 (shame on me).

2004-12-15  Nicolas Clapies  <nclapies@entrouvert.com>

	Reordered function declarations. Added check of server param.

2004-12-15  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	fixed a few "variable might be used uninitialized in this function" detected with gcc-3.4 -O3.

2004-12-15  Nicolas Clapies  <nclapies@entrouvert.com>

	Added support of modify request from a SP to AP : updated element's class in level 1 (Modify and ModifyResponse) and implemented modify request in level 2 id wsf.

2004-12-15  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	added new standard error code LASSO_PROFILE_ERROR_BUILDING_QUERY_FAILED

	new LASSO_PROFILE_ERROR_NAME_IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND error code

	coherent error handling for "identity not found" and "federation not found" cases.

2004-12-14  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	replaced unknown error by 2 LASSO_PROFILE_ERROR_INVALID_HTTP_METHOD in Name Identifier Mapping profile.

	new LASSO_PROFILE_ERROR_UNKNOWN_PROFILE_URL profile error and replaced a bunch of 'return -1;' with that one.

	fixed some missing or wrong prototype declarations

	fixed function declared as returning int that didn't return anything

	API change in Single Sign On profile (IdP side) to allow the developer to mess with <lib:Assertion/>
	Outlined in http://lists.labs.libre-entreprise.org/pipermail/lasso-devel/2004-December/001119.html

	more error code harmony, now with a new critical_error macro

	status code has been set in lasso_lib_logout_respone_new_full

	properly sign samlp:Response

	properly check signature on soap samlp:Request (login/artifact)

	properly verify signatures and return code appriopriately (closes: #362)

	updated test to new api

	updated test to new API

	ignore generated files

	ignore html rendition

	process files taken from lasso 0.5 (not uptodate)

	got uptodate documentation about single sign on (I think)

	[API Change] For consistency with the other profiles, remote_providerID has been moved from build_authn_request_msg to init_authn_request in both Single Sign-On and LECP profiles.  [details on lasso-devel@]

2004-12-13  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	error codes handling in LassoLogin

	use XmlSnippet for LassoLogout dump/restore

	reenabled lasso_session_destroy()

	more error code harmonization.

	sign AuthnResponse and harmonous use of LASSO_PROFILE_ERROR_INVALID_MSG

	removed obsolete comment

	harmonized remote_provider tests (check and error code set to LASSO_SERVER_ERROR_PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND)

	replaced error_code macro with a function since that macro didn't work with gcc 2.95

	error message for LASSO_SERVER_ERROR_ADD_PROVIDER_FAILED

	removed trailing ; in macro

	dealing with errors; now like this:   return error_code(G_LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL, LASSO_SERVER_ERROR_ADD_PROVIDER_FAILED);

2004-12-12  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	properly sign soap messages in name identifier mapping profile.

	got top-of-file license spaced the same way as in other files (+ fixed editor typo)

	removed error message when java was not found

2004-12-10  Valery Febvre  <vfebvre at easter-eggs.com>

	Added LassoDiscovery class

	Added lasso_server_add_service() method

	Added LassoService class

	Fixed the attribute name of the dump version

2004-12-10  Nicolas Clapies  <nclapies@entrouvert.com>

	Added lasso_personal_profile_service_add_data() method : it allows to add response elements corresponding to the requested attribute values.

	Removed params of constructor : id and itemIDRef are not required attributes.

	Added support of MsgContact PP service.

	Initial version : support of personal profile msg contact. It is very experimental and only supports msg account and msg provider part.

2004-12-10  Valery Febvre  <vfebvre at easter-eggs.com>

	Removed useless LassoDiscoResourceIDGroup class

2004-12-10  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	Added back xmlsec signature check (and disabled it in name identifier mapping profile since it is buggy there).  The signature check requires another call to xmlParseMemory; this makes them 3 per SOAP message (sign check + lasso_profile_get_request_type_from_soap_msg and lasso_node_init_from_message). I'll think further about this.

2004-12-10  Nicolas Clapies  <nclapies@entrouvert.com>

	Fixed type mistake in snippets of LassoDstQueryItem.

	Added support of DST modify / modify response.

	Replaced LassoDiscoResourceIDGroup with old ResourceID and EncryptedResourceID.

	Updated lasso_personal_profile_service_init_query() method : now it takes a LassoDiscoResourceOffering* resourceOfferring, a LassoDiscoDescription* description and a char* select, init a Query object, set the soap url from ResourceOffering, and return a QueryItem* to optionaly set attributes. Now it is possible to add extra QueryItems with lasso_personal_profile_service_add_query_item(). It returns the new QueryItem'pointer to set optional attributes;

	Removed ResourceOffering and ResourceIDGroup class's attributes. Only keep data and queryItem attributes. Removed old unused private methods (dispose() and finalize() )

	Updated lasso_wsf_profile_build_*_msg() : now they only set msg_body class's attribute with a soap message (request / response).

	Added DST Modify part level 1.

2004-12-10  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	overridden spelling fix caused alignment wreckage

	removed XmlSnippetObsolete, no longer used anywhere. lasso_node_build_xmlNode_from_snippets made static and documented some new functions.

	reenabled signature checking on query strings (xml messages still to do)

	moved NameRegistration to XmlSnippet

	removed unnecessary namespace declaration

	removed unnecessary private_data in LassoFederation; consequence being instance_init, class_init, dispose and finalise have also been removed.

	removed struct LassoLoginPrivate declaration

	Moved LassoLogin to XmlSnippet; not completely since an enum is converted in string and I'm not sure it is a good idea to 1) store them as integer or 2) adds the mapping value->string to xml.c.  Also removed unused LassoLoginPrivate variable/struct/

2004-12-09  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	use xml snippet in LassoProfile; better faster stronger.

	don't sign query if not asked to; and fixed SNIPPET_NODE_IN_CHILD support

	Removed process of ResourceOffering param. Need to be reactivated when ResourceID process in level 1 will be completed.

2004-12-08  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

	For Swig, corrected server providerIds. Added providerIds to identities and sessions.

2004-12-08  Valery Febvre  <vfebvre at easter-eggs.com>

	Added LassoDiscoResourceID and LassoDiscoEncryptedResourceID classes

2004-12-08  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	reviewed code marked with XXX

2004-12-08  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

2004-12-07  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	another round on snippets; no longer multiply types for content transformation (CONTENT_BOOLEAN, ATTRIBUTE_BOOLEAN, CONTENT_INTEGER, ATTRIBUTE_INTEGER...), instead does something like this: SNIPPET_ATTRIBUTE | SNIPPET_INTEGER (other combinations allowed)

2004-12-07  Nicolas Clapies  <nclapies@entrouvert.com>

	Fixed #ifndef __LASSO_LIB_DISCO_QUERY_H__ to #ifndef __LASSO_DISCO_QUERY_H__

	cleaning files

	LECP converted to new tree

	Integrated scalp_is_liberty_query into Lasso. Consequently, LASSO_PROFILE_ERROR_INVALID_QUERY is now a negative error code and a critical message is displayed when this error occurs.

	Removed function lasso_login_process_without_authn_request_msg. It has been replaced with:   lasso_login_init_self_addressed_authn_request(remote_providerID);   /* ...Set protocolProfile, isPassive, consent, relayState here... */   lasso_login_process_authn_request_message(NULL,                                             lassoHttpMethodSelfAddressed); This change was needed because there was no way to set isPassive, consent, etc, before.

2004-10-02  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

	Homogeneized error handling for HTTP methods in requests.

	Removed consent from fake authnRequest created by lasso_login_process_without_authn_request_msg: Since the nameIDPolicy is "any", must_ask_for_consent must return true and if the user doesn't give its consent, a one-time nameidentifier should be used.

	In lasso_login_process_without_authn_request_msg, set the isPassive flag of the fake authnRequest to false, so that must_authenticate() returns true.

	*** empty log message ***

	Fixed problem when checking all remote SP from IDP in lasso_logout_validate_request() : replaced lasso_provider_get_singleLogoutProtocolProfile(provider, lassoProviderTypeIdp, NULL) with lasso_provider_get_singleLogoutProtocolProfile(provider, lassoProviderTypeSp, NULL)

	Updated of lasso_logout_validate_request() : now it returns a code error of -301 (unsupported profile) if an IDP receiving a LogoutRequest via SOAP detects other SPs dont support SOAP method.

	Updated process of artifact : now the IDP generates an artifact either or not the user authentication succeeded. When the SP resends the artifact to the IDP in a samlp:Request, it builds a samlp:Response message with Success status code value. If an assertion is found from artifact, then it adds it to the response. Finally, the IDP responds to the SP with the SOAP message

	When you make change in header files (such as [1]) think about the bindings and
	adapt them; thanks.

	[1] http://cvs.labs.libre-entreprise.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/lasso/lasso/environs/server.c.diff?r1=1.54;r2=1.55;cvsroot=lasso

2004-08-21  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	replaced lots of const char* wasting memory and a treat to binary compatibility with lots of #define wasting nothing at all.

	doesn't fail on second run

	I prefer it that way

	reenabled tests since the swig binding is ok now

2004-08-21  Valery Febvre  <vfebvre at easter-eggs.com>

2004-08-20  Romain Chantereay  <rchantereau@entrouvert.com>

	Created unprefixed PHP_UNPREFIXED_EXTENTION_DIR in order to prefix it with the supplied configure prefix. Is it useful in this PHP special case ? I do not think so, but, the user is the master.
	Moved the libtool bad versionning computation after program tests in order to
	use the founded sed program ($SED) and not just 'sed'.

	Every calls to 'sed' use the founded 'sed' ($SED).

2004-08-20  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	talking about idpProviderID

	file moved

	Corrections in Python high-level binding:
	- Added missing self in previous commit.

	- Server default constructor allows again to give no arguments.

2004-08-20  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

	I have always wanted that Python bindings for GTK, libXML, etc, allow the user to override the classes they define. So I did it for Lasso Python high-level bindings.

2004-08-20  Valery Febvre  <vfebvre at easter-eggs.com>

2004-08-20  Frederic Peters  <fpeters@entrouvert.com>

	Also look for include files in top_src_dir/lasso.  As for the python binding. I actually think this is a bug; why should lasso_wrap.c include lasso.h and not <lasso/lasso.h> ?

	get your act on ds_signature; please.

2004-08-09  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

	Updated Python unit tests infrastructure, so that it can be reused for independant simulation applications.

	Added module http. It is derived from Expression eponym module, but it is derived from abstractweb and it is designed to be a truly independant module.
	It still need a lot of work, but may be one day, Expression will use it.

	Added module abstractweb. It defines abstract classes for HTTP servers, etc, that are independant of the connection type: They must be overrided for HTTP(S) connection or simulated connections.

	Added module assertions to Python Lasso simulator. This module defines global functions to use for unit tests (instead of methods self.fail...) or for other applications.

	Added module builtins to Python Lasso simulator. builtins will replace environs in Expression one day.

2004-08-08  Valery Febvre  <vfebvre at easter-eggs.com>

	Added LECP support in Python simulator and unit tests. I think I have found several bugs in Lasso LECP implementation.

	userAuthenticated, authenticationMethod, reauthenticateOnOrAfter to lecp
	before (or when) building response envelope with
	lecp.build_authn_response_envelope_msg(). Did I overlook something?

	I thought I had discover one new bug in Lasso SP logout. I was wrong... I discovered one bug and a missing feature:
	- first the feature request: Lasso should set logout.nameIdentifier in
	logout.init_request, because there is no way to retrieve the current
	nameIdentifier from identity_dump or session_dump

	- and now the bug: After the IDP soapEndpoint returns a SOAP response, the
	SP process_response_msg doesn't remove the assertion from session (neither
	does it set session.is_dirty flag).

	See the new test05 for details.

2004-08-03  Emmanuel Raviart  <eraviart@entrouvert.com>

	Python tests now work again, but please remove the Lasso-CRITICAL below.
