2.4.0 - June 6th 2011
---------------------
281 commits, 933 files changed, 45384 insertions, 6313 deletions

Minor version number increase since ABI was extended (new methods).

 - Key rollover support:
   Lasso is now able to accept messages signed by any key declared as a signing
   key in a metadata and not just the last one. You can also decrypt encrypted
   nodes using any of a list of private keys, allowing roll-over of encryption
   certificates. Signing key roll-over is automatic, your provider just have to
   provide the new signing key in their metadata. For multiple-encryption key
   you can load another private key than the one loaded in the LassoServer
   constuctor with code like that:

      >>> import lasso
      >>> server = lasso.Server(our_metadata, first_private_key_path)
      >>> server.setEncryptionPrivateKey(second_private_key_path)

   See the FAQ file for the workflow of a proper key roll-over.

 - Partial logout response now produces a specific error code when parsed by
   lasso_logout_process_response_msg()
 - Bugs in lasso_assertion_query_build_request_msg() were fixed
 - Processing of assertions is not stopped when checking that first level
   status code is not success, so that later code can check the second level
   status code.
 - A new generic error for denied request was added,
   LASSO_PROFILE_ERROR_REQUEST_DENIED
 - A new API lasso_server_load_metadata() was added to load federation files
   (XML files containing metadata from multiple providers) and to check
   signatures on them.
 - Better warning and errors are reported in logs when failing to load a
   metadata file.
 - Bugs around missing namespace declaration for dump file were fixed, it
   prevented reloading dumped object (like LassoLogin).
 - lasso_node_get_xml_node_for_any_type() must be able to copy the content of
   an XML node to another (namespace, attribute and children). It did not, now
   it is fixed. It can be used for example to add specific attribute like «
   xsi:type="string" » to a Saml2AttributeValue. Here is a python snippet to do that:

      >>> import lasso
      >>> a = lasso.Saml2AttributeValue()
      >>> a.setOriginalXmlnode('<Dummy xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="string">Value</Dummy>')
      >>> print a.debug(0)
      <saml:AttributeValue xmlns:saml="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="string">Value</saml:AttributeValue>
 - support for symetric keys signatures: for a long time XMLDsig standard has
   supported HMAC signature, or signature based on a shared secret key an hash
   algorithm. Lasso now supports to share a key with another Lasso using
   service or identity provider and to verify and sign SAML exchange using this
   key. Performance can be 100 times more than with assymetric cryptography,
   i.e. RSA.
 - nodes able to hold any XML attribyte (like saml:AttributeValue) contains a
   hashtable to for holding those attributes, those hashtable have a new syntax
   for attributes of another namespace than the current node namespace,
   inspired by the Python ElementTree library:

    {the_namespace}the_attribute_name

   ex:

    {http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance}type

   for the classic xsi:type attribute.
 - xmldsig:X509Data node now possess a binding as a Lasso object. You can use
   it combined with the new class LassoSaml2KeyInformationDataType to use the
   holder-of-key subject confirmation method.
 - The perfs benchmarking tools now allows to select a different metadata set
   (for example to test with different public key sizes).
 - Perl minimal version for the binding was downgraded to 5
 - pseudo-XSchema validation: the new XML deserializer does more to enforce
   constraints of the schema defining SAML messages. It means Lasso is less
   forgiving with non-conform implementation of SAML.
 - thin-sessions mode: A new flag was added named thin-session, you can set it
   using lasso_set_flag("thin-sessions") or by setting the LASSO_FLAG
   environement variable to the string "thin-sessions". The effect of this flag
   is to remove complete storage of assertions in the LassoSession object,
   which was made mainly to support logout and the artifact binding for ID-FF
   1.2. A new thinner structure is used for supporting logout, and ID-FF 1.2
   can now use the same storage mechanism as the SAML 2 implementation for the
   artifact binding (i.e. using lasso_profile_get_artifact_message after
   artifact generation and lasso_profile_set_artifact_message before artifact
   retrieval).
 - better initialization and access to SessionIndex in logout requests:
   LassoSession now store all generated SessionIndex for a session using a
   small structure, using it the LassoLogout profile can now initialize
   LassoLogout message with all of them. It's not necessary to implement this
   functionnalitý in your service or identity provider anymore.
 - new LassoKey object: this new class was introduced to simplify management of
   keys when using shared key signature. But you can also use it to load
   assymetric keys. In the future it should gain API to do XML signature and
   encryptiong independently of any SAML 2.0 or ID-FF 1.2 exchange. Providing
   the first simple binding of libxmlsec to Python.
 - Improvements to autoconf and automake files to compile under Darwin (Mac Os
   X) and Fedora.
 - a FAQ file was started.
 - added API:

2.3.6 - November 29th 2011
--------------------------

2 commits, 2 files changed, 28 insertions, 2 deletions

 * fix a bug when receiving a signature using the InclusiveNamespaces
   PrefixList by copying namespace declaration from upper level at the level of
   the signed node.
 * fix compilation warning on recent version of GCC


2.3.5 - January 11th 2010
-------------------------

36 commits, 31 files changed, 240 insertions, 92 deletions

Generic:
 * add more backward compatible replacement for GHashTable methods (to compile
   under centos5)
 * a generic way to attach encryption parameters to LassoNode has been added, a
   future major release should see the removal of specific field for storing
   those parameters in node supporting encryption.
 * The way we format encrypted node is now more compatible with Shibboleth and
   I hope with other implementations: the KeyInfo is kept inside the
   EncryptedData element, and not repeated inside a child of the EncryptedElement.
 * Fixed: LASSO_SIGNATURE_VERIFY_HINT_FORCE did not force checking signature on
   messages
 * Fixed: lasso_provider_get_first_http_method broke when an unknown binding
   was found in an endpoint declaration

SAMLv2:
 * Fixed: segfault when checking signature on logout responses (introduced in 2.3.4)
 * SPNameQualifier is more set on subject NameID of assertions, as it should be
   reserved for Affiliation members (and it broke shibboleth which only expect
   this to be used for affiliation, wrongly I think).
 * Conditions->notBefore/notOnOrAfter is motre setted by
   lasso_login_build_assertion, only notOnOrAfter on SubjectConfirmationData,
   which is more inline with the specification.
 * the logout profile now use the session to initialize the NameID in requests,
   not the identity. It allow to have a transient federation in the session but
   a persistent one in the identity
 * fixed support for the POST binding
 * Fixed: it seems that strtol does not reset errno under Centos 5, we do it by hand.

Python binding:
 * constructors now raise a lasso.Error instead of a simple Exception when failing

PHP5 binding:
 * removed dependency upon an internal function of liblasso3


2.3.4 - Otober 8th 2010
-----------------------

21 commits, 18 files changed, 312 insertions, 58 deletions

Generic
 * fix warning for compiling on Pardus and EL5
 * the release tarball now contains the figures for the documentation
 * lasso_login_process_authn_request documentation gained details on returned errors

SAMLv2:
 * report unknown provider instead of an error on parameter value when
   resolving and artifact in an assertionConsumer endpoint and the provider is
   not registered into the server object.
 * lasso_provider_get_assertion_consumer_url now use specific SAMLv2 methods
 * fixed a bug in the ordering of indexed endpoints which produced error when
   looking up the default assertion consumer. It also improved ordering in
   presence of the attribute isDefault="false". A non-regression test was
   added for this functionality.

ID-FFv1.2:
 * respect the signature verify hint when handling authn requests

2.3.3 - October 1st 2010
------------------------

44 commits, 264 files changed, 858 insertions, 401 deletions

Generic:
 * Fixed a lot of memleaks thanks to valgrind, the greatest tool on earth (with
   coccinelle).
 * Add missing annotation creating memleaks in python binding (on lasso_*_dump king   of methods).
 * Fix bad inclusion of an ID-WSF include file when ID-WSF support is not enabled
 * Benchmarking program was updated to measure each part of a WebSSO
   independently (AuthnRequest generation/processing, AuthnResponse
   generation/processing).
 * Add new macro lasso_strisequal and lasso_strisnotequal to avoid errors with
   strcmp. (Thanks to coccinelle semantic patches).

SAMLv2:
 * Add uniform support for LassoProfileVerifySignatureHint for other profiles
   than WebSSO.
 * Report signature errors in response to NameIDNanagement requests
 * Fix wrong use of macro lasso_foreach breaking the mecanism for finding a
   default assertion consumer.
 * Behaviour of lasso_login_build_assertion was modified:
   - when the NameIDPolicy lacks a Format attribute or the Format attribute is
     the unspecified format (see the spec for the corresponding URN). Now it
     results in a transient nameid being generated. If you want it to be
     persistent you must change it before calling this method.
   - the setting of the SubjectConfirmationData->NotOnOrAfter attribute was
     restored as it is mandated by the WebSSO profile. It's the same value as
     Conditions->NotOnOrAfter.
 * Fix missing initialization of Destination attribute on Samlp2StatusResponse
   object for synchronous bindings (Redirect & Post)

2.3.2 - September 7th 2010
--------------------------

 * Fix bug in increment of the libtool version info, increasing the SONAME
   uselessly.

2.3.1 - September 7th 2010
--------------------------

31 commits, 23 files changed, 523 insertions, 356 deletions

 * An ABI breakage was introduced in 2.3.0 with change of value for enumeration
   values LASSO_PROVIDER_ROLE_SP and LASSO_PROVIDER_ROLE_IDP, it breaked code
   compiled with previous version and dumps of server objects. This release fix
   it.
 * SAMLv2 handling of the artifact binding for the WebSSO profile is now
   simpler, no more dumping of the response nodes and signing at the artifact
   building time, the final response is signed when the artifact is generated
   and when unserialized later it is only manipulated as XML for not breaking
   the signature. It fixes usage of ciphered private keys with the
   HTTP-Artifact binding.
 * SAMLv2 internal storage of endpoints was modified to better keep the
   ordering between endpoints, which is espacially important for
   AssertionConsumerService endpoints and difficult to implement well.

2.3.0 - July 21th 2010
----------------------

391 commits, 332 files changed, 13919 insertions, 7137 deletions

So what's new ?

 * Misc:
	- a public key is no more mandatory for building a LassoProvider
	- date parsing now conforms to XSD and ISO8601 specification,
	  especially with respect to milliseconds (they are just ignored, but
	  parsing do not fails now).
	- the encryption private key can be loaded with a password (SAMLv2
	  support only)
	- keep on replacing direct glib data structure manipulation function by
	  safer lasso macros.
	- remove useless verbosity when there is already some error reporting
	  through method return value.
	- add a signature_verify_hint parameter to all profiles, which can be
	  used to specify the policy for verifying signatures. The choices are:
	  - maybe, i.e. let Lasso decides,
	  - force, i.e. always verify, even when it is not needed by the spec,
	  - ignore, i.e. verify, but do not block processing on signature
	    verifications error.
	- add a new snippet type: SNIPPET_COLLECT_NAMESPACES, to collect all
	  declared namespaces in the context of a node. It is needed for
	  interpreting a string value which depend on the locally declared
	  namespaces (like XPath queries).
	- support full syntax for query strings (lasso missed support for
	  semi-colon separator between query string key-value pairs).
	- make LassoServer load its public key like LassoProvider
	- lasso_build_unique_id is now part of the public API
	- add lasso_profile_sso_role_with to decide on the role we have toward
	  another provider (depending on the Identity, the Session or the
	  Server object in this order).
	- add a lasso_node_debug method wich output a human friendly dump (i.e.
	  indented) of a serialized LassoNode, contrary to dump which returns a
	  computer friendly one (dump will conserve signature values, not
	  debug).

 * SAMLv2:
	- constraint on the number of SessionIndex value in a LogoutRequest was
	  worked-around (see
	  lasso_samlp2_logout_request_get/set_session_indexes)
	- full support for encrypted signing key (ID-FFv1.2 is coming in next
	  release)
	- The treatment of assertions consumer endpoints metadata was improved to be
	  what the specification says, i.e find the best default.
	- lasso_assertion_query_build_request_msg now properly initialize the Subject
	  of the query from all possibles sources (first profile->nameIdentifier, then
	  from the identity dump and finally from the session).
	- when a parsed Assertion contains a signature, we return the
	  original_xmlnode instead of serializing the LassoNode content when
	  calling lasso_node_get_xmlNode. This is in order to keep canonical
	  representation of signed assertions. The result is that parsed and
	  signed assertions should be considered read-only with respect to
	  serialization.
	- lasso_login_build_assertion no longer initialize sessionNotOnOrAfter,
	  it must be done explicitely by the IdP implementation. Only the
	  assertion lifetime is set by the arguments.
	- when loading metadata for a provider, we verify that a role
	  descriptor exists for the prescribed role: i.e if you do
	  server.addProvider(lasso.PROVIDER_ROLE_SP, "metadata.xml"), lasso
	  checks that the metadata contain a descriptor for the role "SPSSO".
	- new helper methods to manipulate and check conditions on
	  SAMLv2 assertions.
	- move strings to their own header (but keep retro-compatibility
	  through inclusion in xml/strings.h).

 * Bindings:
	- improve general use of bindings/utils.py module inside the bindings
	  to share type matching logic.

 * Python binding:
	- Glib warning are tunneled through python logging API
	- camelcasing of uppercase starting fields for python and java bindings has
	  been fixed, old orthograph has been also kept for compatibility. The problem
	  could be seen on LassoAssertion object where the field ID was renamed iD
	  which was difficult to guess.
	- node class now supports pickling by leveraging existing XML
	  serialization. It posseses the same limitations as the existing XML
	  serialization, for example serializing a LassProfile is not an
	  idempotent operation, it will miss the server, identity and session
	  fields.
	- empty GList now return an empty tuple, not None (it fixes a lot
	  list traversal codes)
	- do not forget to emit 'pass' in declaration of class without any
	  content (no method, no field, no constructor)
	- the code to emit 'freeing' code for values was factorized and improved.
	- for empty lists returns an empty pyhon list, not None.

 * Perl binding:
	- support for out parameters was added.
	- better memory freeing

 * Java binding:
	- finished exception support for error returning methods.
	- optimize the makefile for file listing generation
	- for NULL GList returns an empty ArrayList object, not null.

 * Documentation:
	- add examples to LassoLogout documentation
	- fix missing or deprecated methods in lasso-sections.txt
	- document LassoIdWsf2Profile methods
	- document runtime flags

 * Tests:
	- new macros to help in testing (see tests/tests.h), they also make
	  better error reporting (when comparing values, they show the expected
	  and the obtained value).
	- SAMLv2 AuthnRequest through HTTP-Artifact binding is tested
	- SAMLv2 LogoutRequest with multiple SessionIndex is tested
	- force C locale for integration test (we match UI strings, so it is
	  needed).
	- SAMLv2, test websso with encrypted private keys (idp and sp side)
	- SAMLv2, add a python test for attribute authority

 * ID-WSF 2.0:
	- constant strings were moved to their own header
	  (lasso/xml/id-wsf-2.0/idwsf2_strings.h)
	- add helper method to retrieve the bootstrap EPR from an assertion and
	  to mint assertion to use as WS-Security tokens.
	- add method lasso_idwsf2_data_service_get_query_item_result_content to
	  retrieve DST query result as text
	- sign SAMLv2 assertion used as WS-Security tokens

And many minor bug-fixes...

2.2.91 - January 26th 2010
--------------------------

A new Perl binding, fix for backward compatibility with old versions of glib,
LassoLogout API is more robust since it does not need anymore for all SP logout
to finish to work, new macro lasso_list_add_new_xml_node, add support for
WS-Security UsernameToken (equivalent of poor man HTTP Digest Authentication),
make public internal APIs: lasso_session_add_assertion,
lasso_session_get_assertion and lasso_session_remove_assertion.

2.2.90 - January 18th 2010
--------------------------

Lots of internal changes and some external one too.

There is a new api to force, forbid or let Lasso sign messages, it is called
lasso_profile_set_signature_hint.

Big overhaul of the ID-WSF 1 and 2 codes, and of the SAML 2.0 profiles. Now all
SAML 2.0 profile use common internal functions from the lasso_saml20_profile_
namespace to handle bindings (SOAP,Redirect,POST,Artifact,PAOS). New internal
API to load SSL keys from many more formats from the public API.

In ID-WSF 2.0, Data Service Template has been simplified, we no more try to
apply queries, it is the responsability of the using code to handle them.

In bindings land, the file bindings/utils.py has been stuffed with utility
function to manipulate 'type' tuple, with are now used to transfer argument and
type description, their schema is (name, C-type, { dictionary of options } ),
they are now used everywhere in the different bindings. We support output
argument in PHP5, Python and Java, i.e. pointer of pointer arguments with are
written to in order to return multiple values. For language where the binding
convert error codes to exceptions (all of them now), the ouput value is
returned as the normal return value of the method, so only one output argument
is handled for now.

We now use GObject-introspection annotations in the documentation to transfer
to the binding generator the necessary metadata about the API (content of
lists, hashtables, wheter pointer are caller/callee owned, can be NULL or if
argument have a default value). The file bindings/override.xml is now
deprecated.

In documentation land, the main reference documentation was reorganizaed and
more symbols have been added to it. Many more functions are documented.

There is now tools to control the evolution of the ABI/API of Lasso.
